"""19578124""","""The monogenic primary dystonias.""","""Presently, 17 distinct monogenic primary dystonias referred to as dystonias 1- 4, 5a,b, 6-8, 10-13 and 15-18 (loci DYT 1-4, 5a,b, 6-8, 10-13, 15-18) have been recognized. Twelve forms are inherited as autosomal dominant, four as autosomal recessive and one as an X-linked recessive trait. Three additional autosomal dominant forms (DYT9, DYT19 and DYT20) might exist based on linkage mapping to regions apparently different from, yet in close proximity to or overlapping with the known loci DYT18, DYT10 and DYT8. Clinically, this group of movement disorders includes pure dystonias and dystonia plus syndromes. In addition, dyskinesias (paroxysmal dystonias), although phenotypically distinct from classical dystonias, are discussed within this group. In pure dystonias, dystonia is occasionally accompanied by tremor. In dystonia plus syndromes, dystonia as the prominent sign concurs with other movement abnormalities such as myoclonus and parkinsonism. In the dyskinesias, dystonia occurs as a paroxysmal sign in association with other movement anomalies and sometimes seizures. While gross neuropathological changes are absent in most primary dystonias, including the paroxysmal forms, striking morphological alterations are found in some, such as in the X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism syndrome (DYT3). Neuropathological findings at the microscopic level have also been reported in several cases of dystonia 1 and 5, both of which were previously thought to be morphologically normal. One locus, DYT14 had been erroneously assigned, by linkage mapping, in a family with dystonia 5. There are two forms of dystonia 5, one autosomal dominant and one autosomal recessive. These forms are designated here as dystonia 5a and dystonia 5b (DYT5a, DYT5b), respectively. The disease gene has been identified in 10 primary dystonias, seven autosomal dominant (TOR1A/DYT1, GCH1/DYT5a, THAP1/DYT6, PNKD1/MR-1/DYT8, SGCE/DYT11, ATP1A3/DYT12 and SLC2A1/DYT18), two autosomal recessive (TH/DYT5b and PRKRA/DYT16) and one X-chromosomal recessive (TAF1/DYT3). This article summarizes all known aspects on each of the monogenic primary dystonias, including phenotype, neuropathology, imaging, inheritance, mapping, molecular genetics, molecular pathology, animal models and treatment. Suggestions for the diagnostic procedure in primary dystonias are given. Although much is now known about the molecular basis of primary dystonias, treatment of patients is still mainly symptomatic. The only exceptions are dystonias 5a and 5b with their excellent long-term response to L-dopa substitution.""",42,"[[""patients""], [""seizures""], [""tremor""], [""ATP1A3""], [""dystonia""], [""movement disorders""], [""myoclonus""], [""parkinsonism""], [""movement abnormalities""], [""paroxysmal dystonias""], [""SLC2A1""], [""dystonias""], [""L-dopa""], [""dyskinesias""], [""GCH1""], [""SGCE""], [""DYT5b""], [""TAF1""], [""DYT6""], [""THAP1""], [""PRKRA""], [""TOR1A""], [""DYT3""], [""DYT11""], [""DYT1""], [""patients""], [""dystonia plus syndromes""], [""DYT5a""], [""DYT18""], [""DYT8""], [""seizures""], [""DYT10""], [""dystonias""], [""primary dystonias""], [""X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism syndrome""], [""DYT12""], [""movement anomalies""], [""DYT16""], [""DYT9""], [""dystonias and dystonia plus syndromes""], [""dystonias"", "" dystonia""], [""DYT14""]]"
"""24262166""","""Genetics in dystonia.""","""While Hermann Oppenheim probably described the first cases of genetic (DYT1) dystonia in 1911, the 'modern history' of dystonia genetics dates back to 1994 when mutations in the GTP cyclohydrolase I gene were discovered to cause dopa-responsive dystonia. Due to the advent of next-generation sequencing, the field of dystonia genetics has been evolving very rapidly over the past two years, resulting in the reporting of 'DYT1-25' and, for the first time, in the identification of genes associated with adult-onset focal/segmental dystonia. However, three of these putative new genes still await independent confirmation (TUBB4/DYT4; CIZ1/DYT23; ANO3/DYT24) and only 11 'DYT' genes have been unequivocally demonstrated to cause different forms of dystonia. Based on a recent consensus approach, dystonias are subdivided on clinical grounds into isolated (with or without tremor) and combined (with other movement disorders) forms. Confirmed genes for isolated dystonias include TOR1A/DYT1; THAP1/DYT6; GNAL/DYT25. In the combined forms, dystonia is accompanied by parkinsonism (GCH1/DYT5a; TH/DYT5b; ATP1A3/DYT12; TAF1/DYT3) or myoclonus (SGCE/DYT11). Persistent and paroxysmal forms are distinguished according to their temporal pattern. The paroxysmal forms of dystonia/dyskinesias present with a mixed pattern of hyperkinetic movement disorders (PRRT2/DYT10; MR-1/DYT8; SLC2A1/DYT18).""",39,"[[""Movement Disorders""], [""dystonia""], [""tremor""], [""hyperkinetic movement disorders""], [""Dyskinesias""], [""Parkinsonism""], [""myoclonus""], [""ATP1A3""], [""PRRT2""], [""DYT12""], [""dystonias""], [""ANO3""], [""GNAL""], [""CIZ1""], [""TAF1""], [""GCH1""], [""SLC2A1""], [""dopa-responsive dystonia""], [""MR-1""], [""SGCE""], [""DYT11""], [""DYT1""], [""DYT6""], [""TOR1A""], [""THAP1""], [""DYT5b""], [""DYT3""], [""DYT25""], [""DYT24""], [""GTP cyclohydrolase I""], [""DYT4""], [""segmental dystonia""], [""DYT5a""], [""DYT18""], [""DYT8""], [""isolated dystonias""], [""TUBB4""], [""DYT23""], [""DYT10""]]"

"""24092288""","""Dystonia.""","""<h4>Purpose of review</h4>The purpose of this review is to provide an update on the classification, phenomenology, pathophysiology, and treatment of dystonia.<h4>Recent findings</h4>A revised definition based on the main phenomenologic features of dystonia has recently been developed in an expert consensus approach. Classification is based on two main axes: clinical features and etiology. Currently, genes have been reported for 14 types of monogenic isolated and combined dystonia. Isolated dystonia (with dystonic tremor) can be caused by mutations in TOR1A (DYT1), TUBB4 (DYT4), THAP1 (DYT6), PRKRA (DYT16), CIZ1 (DYT23), ANO3 (DYT24), and GNAL (DYT25). Combined dystonias (with parkinsonism or myoclonus) are further subdivided into persistent (GCHI [DYT5], SGCE [DYT11], and ATP1A3 [DYT12], with TAF1 most likely but not yet proven to be linked to DYT3) and paroxysmal (PNKD [DYT8], PRRT2 [DYT10], and SLC2A1 [DYT18]). Recent insights from neurophysiologic studies identified functional abnormalities in two networks in dystonia: the basal ganglia-sensorimotor network and, more recently, the cerebellothalamocortical pathway. Besides the well-known lack of inhibition at different CNS levels, dystonia is specifically characterized by maladaptive plasticity in the sensorimotor cortex and loss of cortical surround inhibition. The exact role (modulatory or compensatory) of the cerebellar-cortical pathways still has to be further elucidated. In addition to botulinum toxin for focal forms, deep brain stimulation of the globus pallidus internus is increasingly recognized as an effective treatment for generalized and segmental dystonia.<h4>Summary</h4>The revised classification and identification of new genes for different forms of dystonia, including adult-onset segmental dystonia, enable an improved diagnostic approach. Recent pathophysiologic insights have fundamentally contributed to a better understanding of the disease mechanisms and impact on treatment, such as functional neurosurgery and nonpharmacologic treatment options.""",37,"[[""ATP1A3""], [""dystonia""], [""CIZ1""], [""PNKD""], [""myoclonus""], [""parkinsonism""], [""functional abnormalities""], [""PRRT2""], [""SLC2A1""], [""Dystonia""], [""SGCE""], [""GNAL""], [""DYT25""], [""DYT24""], [""TAF1""], [""dystonic tremor""], [""ANO3""], [""DYT6""], [""THAP1""], [""PRKRA""], [""TOR1A""], [""DYT4""], [""DYT3""], [""DYT11""], [""PNKD""], [""DYT1""], [""DYT5""], [""DYT18""], [""DYT8""], [""DYT23""], [""DYT10""], [""segmental dystonia""], [""DYT12""], [""DYT16""], [""TUBB4""], [""Combined dystonias""], [""ganglia-sensorimotor""]]"

To provide a framework for cellular and systems study of DYT1 dystonia, we characterized the genetic, behavioral, morphological and neurochemical features of transgenic mice expressing either human wild-type torsinA (hWT) or mutant torsinA (hMT1 and hMT2) and their wild-type (WT) littermates. Relative to human brain, hMT1 mice showed robust neural expression of human torsinA transcript (3.90x). In comparison with WT littermates, hMT1 mice had prolonged traversal times on both square and round raised-beam tasks and more slips on the round raised-beam task. Although there were no effects of genotype on rotarod performance and rope climbing, hMT1 mice exhibited increased hind-base widths in comparison to WT and hWT mice. In contrast to several other mouse models of DYT1 dystonia, we were unable to identify either torsinA- and ubiquitin-positive cytoplasmic inclusion bodies or nuclear bleb formation in hMT1 mice. High-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection was used to determine cerebral cortical, striatal, and cerebellar levels of dopamine (DA), norepinephrine, epinephrine, serotonin, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), homovanillic acid (HVA) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid. Although there were no differences in striatal DA levels between WT and hMT1 mice, DOPAC and HVA concentrations and DA turnover (DOPAC/DA and HVA/DA) were significantly higher in the mutants. Our findings in DYT1 transgenic mice are compatible with previous neuroimaging and postmortem neurochemical studies of human DYT1 dystonia. Increased striatal dopamine turnover in hMT1 mice suggests that the nigrostriatal pathway may be a site of functional neuropathology in DYT1 dystonia.""",37,"[[""human""], [""mouse""], [""mice""], [""dystonia""], [""transgenic mice""], [""norepinephrine""], [""epinephrine""], [""dopamine""], [""serotonin""], [""5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid""], [""torsinA""], [""DYT1""], [""dopamine""], [""transgenic mice""], [""homovanillic acid""], [""HVA""], [""DA""], [""TOR1A""], [""GAG""], [""DOPAC""], [""GAG""], [""DYT1""], [""torsinA""], [""torsinA""], [""human""], [""mouse""], [""homovanillic acid""], [""HVA""], [""mice""], [""dopamine""], [""dopamine""], [""serotonin""], [""primary dystonia""], [""3"", ""4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid""], [""DYT1""], [""hMT1""], [""hMT2""]]"

In this observational study, we assessed the utility of [18F]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG)-PET in understanding dystonia pathophysiology by revealing specific resting awake brain glucose metabolism patterns in different childhood dystonia subgroups. PET scans from 267 children with dystonia being evaluated for possible Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) surgery between September 2007 and February 2018 at Evelina London Children's Hospital (ELCH) United Kingdom were examined. Scans without gross anatomical abnormality (e.g. large cysts, significant ventriculomegaly; n = 240) were analysed with Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM12). Glucose metabolism patterns were examined in the 144/240 (60%) cases with the ten commonest childhood-onset dystonias, focusing on nine anatomical regions. A group of thirty-nine adult controls was used for comparisons. The genetic dystonias were associated with the following genes: TOR1A, THAP1, SGCE, KMT2B, HPRT1 (Lesch Nyhan disease), PANK2 and GCDH (Glutaric Aciduria type 1). The acquired Cerebral Palsy (CP) cases were divided into those related to prematurity (CP-Preterm), neonatal jaundice/kernicterus (CP-Kernicterus) and hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (CP-Term). Each dystonia subgroup had distinct patterns of altered FDG-PET uptake. Focal glucose hypometabolism of the pallidi, putamina, or both, was the commonest finding, except in PANK2, where basal ganglia metabolism appeared normal. HPRT1 uniquely showed glucose hypometabolism across all nine cerebral regions. Temporal lobe glucose hypometabolism was found in KMT2B, HPRT1 and CP-Kernicterus. Frontal lobe hypometabolism was found in SGCE, HPRT1, and PANK2. Thalamic and brainstem hypometabolism were seen only in HPRT1, CP-Preterm and CP-term dystonia cases. The combination of frontal and parietal lobe hypermetabolism was uniquely found in CP-term cases. PANK2 cases showed a distinct combination of parietal hypermetabolism with cerebellar hypometabolism but intact putaminal-pallidal glucose metabolism. HPRT1, PANK2, CP-kernicterus and CP-preterm cases had cerebellar and insula glucose hypometabolism as well as parietal glucose hypermetabolism.

Evidence suggests that TOR1A mutation produces dystonia through an aberrant neuronal signalling within the striatum, where D2 dopamine receptors (D2R) produce an abnormal excitatory response in cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) in different models of DYT1 dystonia. The excitability of ChIs may be modulated by group I metabotropic glutamate receptor subtypes (mGlu1 and 5). We performed electrophysiological and calcium imaging recordings from ChIs of both knock-in mice heterozygous for Δ-torsinA (Tor1a(+/Δgag) mice) and transgenic mice overexpressing human torsinA (hMT1). We demonstrate that the novel negative allosteric modulator (NAM) of metabotropic glutamate 5 (mGlu) receptor, dipraglurant (ADX48621) counteracts the abnormal membrane responses and calcium rise induced either by the D2R agonist quinpirole or by caged dopamine (NPEC-Dopamine) in both models. These inhibitory effects were mimicked by two other well-characterized mGlu5 receptor antagonists, SIB1757 and MPEP, but not by mGlu1 antagonism. D2R and mGlu5 post-receptor signalling may converge on PI3K/Akt pathway. Interestingly, we found that the abnormal D2R response was prevented by the selective PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, whereas PLC and PKC inhibitors were both ineffective. Currently, no satisfactory pharmacological treatment is available for DYT1 dystonia patients. Our data show that negative modulation of mGlu5 receptors may counteract abnormal D2R responses, normalizing cholinergic cell excitability, by modulating the PI3K/Akt post-receptor pathway, thereby representing a novel potential treatment of DYT1 dystonia.""",34,"[[""patients""], [""human""], [""mice""], [""dystonia""], [""calcium""], [""transgenic mice""], [""dopamine""], [""Akt""], [""D2R""], [""autosomal dominantly inherited disorder""], [""glutamate""], [""LY294002""], [""DYT1""], [""Dopamine""], [""MPEP""], [""TOR1A""], [""Tor1a""], [""D2R""], [""Tor1a""], [""DYT1""], [""patients""], [""torsinA""], [""DYT1 dystonia""], [""quinpirole""], [""human""], [""mice""], [""dopamine""], [""torsion dystonia""], [""D2 dopamine receptor""], [""hMT1""], [""DYT1 dystonia""], [""D2 dopamine receptors""], [""NPEC""], [""SIB1757""]]"

"""20132487""","""Function of dopamine transporter is compromised in DYT1 transgenic animal model in vivo.""","""Early onset torsion dystonia (DYT1), the most common form of hereditary primary dystonia, is caused by a mutation in the TOR1A gene, which codes for the protein, torsinA. We previously examined the effect of the human mutant torsinA on striatal dopaminergic function in a conventional transgenic mouse model of DYT1 dystonia (hMT1), in which human mutant torsinA is expressed under the cytomegalovirus promotor. Systemic administration of amphetamine did not increase dopamine (DA) release as efficiently in these mice as compared with wild-type transgenic and non-transgenic mice. We, now, studied the contribution of the DA transporter (DAT) to amphetamine-induced DA release in hMT1 transgenic mice using in vivo no-net flux microdialysis. This method applies different concentrations of DA through the microdialysis probe and measures DA concentration at the output of the probe following an equilibrium period. The slope (extraction fraction) is the measure of the DAT activity in vivo. The slope for hMT1 transgenic mice was 0.58 +/- 0.07 and for non-transgenic animals, 0.87 +/- 0.06 (p < 0.05). We further investigated the efficacy of nomifensine (a specific DAT inhibitor) in inhibiting amphetamine-induced DA release. Local application of nomifensine 80 min before the systemic application of amphetamine inhibited DA release in both transgenic mice and their non-transgenic littermates. The efficiency of the inhibition appeared to be different, with mean values of 48% for hMT1 transgenic mice versus 84% for non-transgenic littermates. Moreover, we have evaluated basal and amphetamine-induced locomotion in hMT1 transgenic mice compared with their non-transgenic littermates, using an O-maze behavioral chamber. Basal levels of locomotion in the hMT1 transgenic mice showed that they moved much less than their non-transgenic littermates (0.9 +/- 0.3 m for transgenic mice vs. 2.4 +/- 0.7 m for non-transgenic littermates, p < 0.05). This relative reduction in locomotion was also observed following amphetamine administration (48.5 +/- 6.7 m for transgenics vs. 73.7 +/- 9.8 m for non-transgenics, p < 0.05). These results support the finding that there are altered dynamics of DA release and reuptake in hMT1 transgenic mice in vivo, with DAT activity is reduced in the presence of mutant torsinA, which is consistent with behavioral consequences such as reduced locomotion and (previously described) abnormal motor phenotypes such as increased hind-base width and impaired performance on the raised-beam task. These data implies that altered DAT function may contribute to impaired DA neurotransmission and clinical symptoms in human DYT1 dystonia.""",32,"[[""human""], [""mouse""], [""mice""], [""dystonia""], [""transgenic mice""], [""dopamine""], [""transgenic""], [""amphetamine""], [""torsinA""], [""DYT1""], [""dopamine""], [""DA""], [""DAT""], [""TOR1A""], [""DAT""], [""DAT""], [""nomifensine""], [""DYT1""], [""DA transporter""], [""torsinA""], [""torsinA""], [""human""], [""mouse""], [""mice""], [""dopamine""], [""dopamine""], [""DA transporter""], [""transgenic""], [""torsion dystonia""], [""DYT1""], [""hereditary primary dystonia""], [""hMT1""]]"

The paradoxical excitation was caused by overactive muscarinic receptors (mAChRs), leading to a switch in D2R coupling from canonical G<sub>i/o</sub> to noncanonical β-arrestin signaling. We sought to determine whether these mechanisms in <i>Dyt1</i> <sup>ΔGAG/+</sup> mice are shared with <i>Thap1</i> <sup>C54Y/+</sup> knock-in and <i>Gnal</i> <sup>+/-</sup> knock-out dystonia models and to determine the impact of sex. We found <i>Thap1</i> <sup>C54Y/+</sup> mice of both sexes have elevated extracellular striatal acetylcholine and D2R-induced paradoxical ChI excitation, which was reversed by mAChR inhibition. Elevated extracellular acetylcholine was absent in male and female <i>Gnal</i> <sup>+/-</sup> mice, but the paradoxical D2R-mediated ChI excitation was retained and only reversed by inhibition of adenosine A2ARs. The G<sub>i/o</sub>-preferring D2R agonist failed to increase ChI excitability, suggesting a possible switch in coupling of D2Rs to β-arrestin, as seen previously in a DYT1 model. These data show that, whereas elevated extracellular acetylcholine levels are not always detected across these genetic models of human dystonia, the D2R-mediated paradoxical excitation of ChIs is shared and is caused by altered function of distinct G-protein-coupled receptors.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Dystonia is a common and often disabling movement disorder. The usual medical treatment of dystonia is pharmacotherapy with nonselective antagonists of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, which have many undesirable side effects. Development of new therapeutics is a top priority for dystonia research. The current findings, considered in context with our previous investigations, establish a role for cholinergic dysfunction across three mouse models of human genetic dystonia: DYT1, DYT6, and DYT25. The commonality of cholinergic dysfunction in these models arising from diverse molecular etiologies points the way to new approaches for cholinergic modulation that may be broadly applicable in dystonia.""",32,"[[""human""], [""mouse""], [""mice""], [""dystonia""], [""Dystonia""], [""Mouse""], [""movement disorder""], [""adenosine""], [""acetylcholine""], [""D2R""], [""D2R""], [""dopamine D2 receptor""], [""Dystonia""], [""DYT1""], [""Gnal""], [""Thap1""], [""GNAL""], [""D2R""], [""D2R""], [""DYT25""], [""DYT6""], [""THAP1""], [""Gnal""], [""TOR1A""], [""DYT1""], [""Dyt1""], [""human""], [""mouse""], [""mice""], [""adenosine""], [""C54Y""], [""ChI""]]"

However, genetic causes of dystonia remain largely unknown in Asian subjects. To address this, we applied an integrated two-step approach that included gene dosage analysis and a next-generation sequencing panel containing 72 known genes causative for dystonia and related movement disorders to 318 Taiwanese patients with isolated or combined dystonia. Whole-genome sequencing was performed for one multiplex family with no known causative variant. The panel confirmed the genetic diagnosis in 40 probands (12.6%). A genetic diagnosis was more likely with juvenile onset compared with adult onset (24.2% vs 10.8%; P = 0.03) and those with combined features, especially with myoclonus, compared with isolated dystonia (35.3% vs 10.5%; P = 0.004). The most common causative genes were SGCE followed by GCH1, TH, CACNA1B, PRRT2, MR1, CIZ1, PLA2G6, and PRKN. Genetic causes were identified from single cases in TOR1A, TUBB4A, THAP1, ATP1A3, ANO3, GNAL, KMT2B, SLC6A3, ADCY5, CYP27A1, PANK2, C19orf12, and SPG11.

"""20301587""","""SGCE Myoclonus-Dystonia""","""<h4>Clinical characteristics</h4>SGCE myoclonus-dystonia (SGCE-M-D) is a movement disorder characterized by a combination of rapid, brief muscle contractions (myoclonus) and/or sustained twisting and repetitive movements that result in abnormal postures (dystonia). The myoclonic jerks typical of SGCE-M-D most often affect the neck, trunk, and upper limbs with less common involvement of the legs. Approximately 50% of affected individuals have additional focal or segmental dystonia, presenting as cervical dystonia and/or writer's cramp. Non-motor features may include alcohol abuse, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and anxiety disorders. Symptom onset is usually in the first decade of life and almost always by age 20 years, but ranges from age six months to 80 years. Most affected adults report a dramatic reduction in myoclonus in response to alcohol ingestion. SGCE-M-D is compatible with an active life of normal span.<h4>Diagnosis/testing</h4>The diagnosis of SGCE-M-D is established in a proband with characteristic clinical features by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in SGCE.<h4>Management</h4>Treatment of manifestations: Class 1 evidence supports the improvement of myoclonus and dystonia with zonisamide. Benzodiazepines (particularly clonazepam) and antiepileptics used to treat myoclonus (especially valproate and levitiracetam) also improve myoclonus in individuals with myoclonus-dystonia. The response to other antiepileptics (e.g., topiramate) is more variable. Anticholinergic medication may improve dystonia. Botulinum toxin injection may be especially helpful for cervical dystonia. Improvement with L-5-hydroxytryptophan, L-dopa, and the salt of sodium oxybate has been reported. Deep brain stimulation has improved both myoclonus and dystonia, with most targeting the globus pallidus interna (GPi); however, success with ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus (VIM) target has also been reported. Other: Symptoms of SGCE-M-D often improve short term with ingestion of alcohol, but the risk of addiction recommends against its long-term use.<h4>Genetic counseling</h4>SGCE-M-D is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner with penetrance determined by the parental origin of the altered SGCE allele: an SGCE pathogenic variant on the paternally derived (expressed) SGCE allele generally results in disease; a pathogenic variant on the maternally derived (silenced) SGCE allele typically does not result in disease. Most individuals with SGCE-M-D inherited the disorder from a heterozygous parent who may or may not have clinical signs of M-D (as phenotypic expression in the parent would depend on the gender of the transmitting grandparent). Each child of an individual with SGCE-M-D has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Almost all children who inherit an SGCE pathogenic variant from their father develop symptoms, whereas only ~5% of children who inherit an SGCE pathogenic variant from their mother develop symptoms. Once the SGCE pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing and preimplantation genetic diagnosis are possible.""",31,"[[""human"", ""patients"", ""patient"", ""infant"", ""mammalian"", ""infants"", ""boy"", ""child"", ""woman"", ""humans"", ""children"", ""girl"", ""Mammal"", ""boys"", ""participants"", ""women"", ""man"", ""donor"", ""persons"", ""Men"", ""person"", ""people"", ""girls"", ""peoples"", ""participant"", ""outpatient"", ""donor variant"", ""patient variant"", ""mammalians"", ""Homo sapiens"", ""Pt"", ""Homo sapiens Linnaeus, 1758"", ""pts"", ""H. sapiens"", ""humans.

"""31618684""","""Decreased number of striatal cholinergic interneurons and motor deficits in dopamine receptor 2-expressing-cell-specific Dyt1 conditional knockout mice.""","""DYT1 early-onset generalized torsion dystonia is a hereditary movement disorder characterized by abnormal postures and repeated movements. It is caused mainly by a heterozygous trinucleotide deletion in DYT1/TOR1A, coding for torsinA. The mutation may lead to a partial loss of torsinA function. Functional alterations of the basal ganglia circuits have been implicated in this disease. Striatal dopamine receptor 2 (D2R) levels are significantly decreased in DYT1 dystonia patients and in the animal models of DYT1 dystonia. D2R-expressing cells, such as the medium spiny neurons in the indirect pathway, striatal cholinergic interneurons, and dopaminergic neurons in the basal ganglia circuits, contribute to motor performance. However, the function of torsinA in these neurons and its contribution to the motor symptoms is not clear. Here, D2R-expressing-cell-specific Dyt1 conditional knockout (d2KO) mice were generated and in vivo effects of torsinA loss in the corresponding cells were examined. The Dyt1 d2KO mice showed significant reductions of striatal torsinA, acetylcholine metabolic enzymes, Tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA), and cholinergic interneurons. The Dyt1 d2KO mice also showed significant reductions of striatal D2R dimers and tyrosine hydroxylase without significant alteration in striatal monoamine contents or the number of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. The Dyt1 d2KO male mice showed motor deficits in the accelerated rotarod and beam-walking tests without overt dystonic symptoms. Moreover, the Dyt1 d2KO male mice showed significant correlations between striatal monoamines and locomotion. The results suggest that torsinA in the D2R-expressing cells play a critical role in the development or survival of the striatal cholinergic interneurons, expression of striatal D2R mature form, and motor performance. Medical interventions to compensate for the loss of torsinA function in these neurons may affect the onset and symptoms of this disease.""",31,"[[""patients""], [""mice""], [""dystonia""], [""mice""], [""trinucleotide""], [""acetylcholine""], [""dystonic symptoms""], [""D2R""], [""D2R""], [""torsinA""], [""DYT1""], [""dopamine receptor 2""], [""dystonic symptoms""], [""hereditary movement disorder""], [""Dyt1""], [""TOR1A""], [""D2R""], [""D2R""], [""DYT1""], [""TrkA""], [""patients""], [""torsinA""], [""torsinA""], [""Dyt1""], [""DYT1 dystonia""], [""hereditary movement disorder""], [""Tropomyosin receptor kinase A""], [""mice""], [""mice""], [""generalized torsion dystonia""], [""dopamine receptor 2""]]"

TOR1A-associated arthrogryposis multiplex congenita 5 (AMC5) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder arising from biallelic variants in TOR1A, a gene that in the heterozygous state is associated with torsion dystonia-1 (DYT1 or DYT-TOR1A), an early-onset dystonia with reduced penetrance. While 15 individuals with AMC5-TOR1A have been reported (less than 10 in detail), a systematic investigation of the full disease-associated spectrum has not been conducted. Here, we assess the clinical, radiological and molecular characteristics of 57 individuals from 40 families with biallelic variants in TOR1A. Median age at last follow-up was 3 years (0-24 years). Most individuals presented with severe congenital flexion contractures (95%) and variable developmental delay (79%). Motor symptoms were reported in 79% and included lower limb spasticity and pyramidal signs, as well as gait disturbances. Facial dysmorphism was an integral part of the phenotype, with key features being a broad/full nasal tip, narrowing of the forehead and full cheeks. Analysis of disease-associated manifestations delineated a phenotypic spectrum ranging from normal cognition and mild gait disturbance to congenital arthrogryposis, global developmental delay, intellectual disability, absent speech and inability to walk. In a subset, the presentation was consistent with foetal akinesia deformation sequence with severe intrauterine abnormalities. Survival was 71%, with higher mortality in males. Death occurred at a median age of 1.2 months (1 week-9 years), due to respiratory failure, cardiac arrest or sepsis. Analysis of brain MRI studies identified non-specific neuroimaging features, including a hypoplastic corpus callosum (72%), foci of signal abnormality in the subcortical and periventricular white matter (55%), diffuse white matter volume loss (45%), mega cisterna magna (36%) and arachnoid cysts (27%). The molecular spectrum included 22 distinct variants, defining a mutational hotspot in the C-terminal domain of the Torsin-1A protein. Genotype-phenotype analysis revealed an association of missense variants in the 3-helix bundle domain to an attenuated phenotype, while missense variants near the Walker A/B motif as well as biallelic truncating variants were linked to early death. In summary, this systematic cross-sectional analysis of a large cohort of individuals with biallelic TOR1A variants across a wide age-range delineates the clinical and genetic spectrum of TOR1A-related autosomal-recessive disease and highlights potential predictors for disease severity and survival.""",30,"[[""death""], [""neurodegeneration""], [""inability""], [""neurodevelopmental disorder""], [""dystonia""], [""respiratory failure""], [""mortality""], [""arachnoid cysts""], [""sepsis""], [""neurodevelopmental disorders""], [""cardiac arrest""], [""lower limb spasticity""], [""autosomal-recessive disease""], [""Death""], [""C""], [""arthrogryposis multiplex congenita""], [""congenital arthrogryposis""], [""akinesia deformation""], [""Facial dysmorphism""], [""white matter volume loss""], [""TOR1A""], [""DYT1""], [""white matter volume loss""], [""TOR1A""], [""hypoplastic corpus callosum""], [""death""], [""Torsin-1A""], [""autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative diseases""], [""torsion dystonia-1""], [""congenital flexion contractures""]]"

Autoradiography was used to assess the functional DAT binding in striatum. Striatal dopamine and its metabolites were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography. After nerve crush injury, we found abnormal posturing in the lesioned hindlimb of both mutant and wt mice indicating the profound influence of the nerve lesion (15x vs. 12x relative to control) resembling human peripheral pseudodystonia. In mutant mice the phenotypic abnormalities were increased by about 40 % (p < 0.05). This was accompanied by complex alterations of striatal dopamine homeostasis. Pharmacological blockade of dopamine synthesis reduced severity of dystonia-like movements, whereas treatment with L-Dopa aggravated these but only in mutant mice suggesting a DYT1 related central component relevant to the development of abnormal involuntary movements.

Analysis of striatal tissue dopamine (DA) and metabolites using HPLC revealed no difference between hMT1 mice and their non-transgenic littermates. Pre-synaptic DA transporters were studied using in vitro autoradiography with [(3)H]mazindol, a ligand for the membrane DA transporter, and [(3)H]dihydrotetrabenazine, a ligand for the vesicular monoamine transporter. No difference in the density of striatal DA transporter or vesicular monoamine transporter binding sites was observed. Post-synaptic receptors were studied using [(3)H]SCH-23390, a ligand for D(1) class receptors, [(3)H]YM-09151-2 and a ligand for D(2) class receptors. There were again no differences in the density of striatal binding sites for these ligands. Using in vivo microdialysis in awake animals, we studied basal as well as amphetamine-stimulated striatal extracellular DA levels. Basal extracellular DA levels were similar, but the response to amphetamine was markedly attenuated in the hMT1 mice compared with their non-transgenic littermates (253 +/- 71% vs. 561 +/- 132%, p < 0.05, two-way anova). These observations suggest that the mutation in the torsinA protein responsible for DYT1 dystonia may interfere with transport or release of DA, but does not alter pre-synaptic transporters or post-synaptic DA receptors.

Early-onset torsion dystonia (EOTD) is one such disorder characterized by sustained and involuntary muscle contractions that frequently cause repetitive movements or abnormal postures. Transmitted in an autosomal dominant manner with reduced penetrance, EOTD is caused in most cases by the deletion of a glutamic acid (DeltaE) in the DYT1 (also known as TOR1A) gene product, torsinA. Although some patients respond well to anticholingerics, therapy is primarily limited to either neurosurgery or chemodenervation. As mutant torsinA (DeltaE) expression results in decreased torsinA function, therapeutic strategies directed toward enhancement of wild-type (WT) torsinA activity in patients who are heterozygous for mutant DYT1 may restore normal cellular functionality. Here, we report results from the first-ever screen for candidate small molecule therapeutics for EOTD, using multiple activity-based readouts for torsinA function in Caenorhabditis elegans, subsequent validation in human DYT1 patient fibroblasts, and behavioral rescue in a mouse model of DYT1 dystonia. We exploited the nematode to rapidly discern chemical effectors of torsinA and identified two classes of antibiotics, quinolones and aminopenicillins, which enhance WT torsinA activity in two separate in vivo assays. Representative molecules were assayed in EOTD patient fibroblasts for improvements in torsinA-dependent secretory function, which was improved significantly by ampicillin. Furthermore, a behavioral defect associated with an EOTD mouse knock-in model was also rescued following administration of ampicillin.

Recently, a transgenic mouse model of DYT1 has been described, expressing either the human wild-type torsinA (hWT) or mutant torsinA (hMT). We recorded the activity of striatal cholinergic interneurons of hWT, hMT, and control mice. In slice preparations, no significant differences were observed in resting membrane potential (RMP), firing activity, action potential duration or Ih current. Quinpirole, a D2-like dopamine receptor agonist, did not produce detectable effects on RMP of cholinergic interneurons in control mice and hWT mice, but in the hMT mice caused membrane depolarization and an increase in the firing rate. D2 receptor activation inhibits N-type high-voltage-activated calcium currents. We found that, in isolated interneurons from hMT mice, the quinpirole-mediated inhibition of N-type currents was significantly larger than in hWT and controls. Moreover, the N-type component was significantly over-represented in hMT mice. The altered sensitivity of N-type channels in hMT mice could account for the paradoxical excitatory effect of D2 stimulation. Our data support the existence of an imbalance between striatal dopaminergic and cholinergic signaling in DYT1 dystonia.""",26,"[[""human""], [""mouse""], [""mice""], [""mouse""], [""dystonia""], [""autosomal dominant disease""], [""calcium""], [""calcium""], [""dopamine""], [""dystonia""], [""torsinA""], [""DYT1""], [""D2 receptor""], [""D2""], [""hMT""], [""torsinA""], [""torsinA""], [""Quinpirole""], [""quinpirole""], [""human""], [""mouse""], [""mice""], [""dopamine""], [""torsion dystonia""], [""D2 receptor""], [""DYT1""]]"
"""19685389""","""[Genetics of dystonia].""","""The dystonias comprise a heterogeneous group of movement disorders. In contrast to the frequent sporadic forms, a variety of rare familial forms are caused by genetic mutations with mendelian inheritance. In recent years, significant progress has been made with regard to the identification of genes causing dystonia, and to the molecular pathophysiology underlying dystonic symptoms. Currently, 18 gene loci have been described causing primary dystonia, dystonia-plus syndromes or paroxysmal dystonia. The most frequent form of inherited dystonia, according to current knowledge, is early-onset generalized DYT1 dystonia, caused by a deletion of three basepairs, GAG, in the DYT1 (TOR1A) gene. It is thought that the protein encoded by this gene, torsinA, participates in association of the endoplasmatic reticulum and the nuclear envelope with the cytoskeleton and hereby might influence the reaction of cells to various stresses and/or the development of specific neuronal populations involved in movement control in the brain. Other genes which have only recently been identified include: THAP1, causing adolescent-onset primary dystonia of mixed type (DYT6); ATP1A3, responsible for Rapid-Onset Dystonia-Parkinsonism (RDP, DYT12); PRKRA, causing young-onset dystonia-parkinsonism (DYT16); and SLC2A1, causing paroxysmal exertion-induced dystonia with haemolytic anemia (DYT18).

We utilized the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) promoter to direct transgene expression specifically to dopaminergic neurons of the midbrain to identify cell-autonomous abnormalities. Expression of both the human wild type (hTorsinA) and mutant (DeltaE-hTorsinA) protein resulted in alterations of dopamine release as detected by microdialysis and fast cycle voltammetry. Motor abnormalities detected in these mice mimicked those noted in transgenic mice with pan-neuronal transgene expression. The locomotor response to cocaine in both TH-hTorsinA and TH-DeltaE-hTorsinA, in the face of abnormal extracellular DA levels relative to non-transgenic mice, suggests compensatory, post-synaptic alterations in striatal DA transmission.

A total of 292 sporadic isolated dystonia patients and 316 control individuals were genotyped for single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of GCH1 (rs3759664:G > A, rs12147422:A > G and rs10483639:C > G) and TOR1A (rs13300897:G > A, rs1801968:G > C, rs1182:G > T and rs3842225:G > Δ) using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and confirmed by direct Sanger sequencing.

DYT1 early-onset primary dystonia is the most common form of hereditary dystonia and is caused by deletion of a glutamic acid residue (302/303) near the carboxyl-terminus of encoded torsinA. TorsinA is localized primarily within the contiguous lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and nuclear envelope (NE), and is hypothesized to function as a molecular chaperone and an important regulator of the ER stress-signaling pathway, but how the mutation in torsinA causes disease remains unclear. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the clinical symptoms of dystonia result from abnormalities in dopamine (DA) signaling, and possibly involving its down-stream effector adenylate cyclase that produces the second messenger cyclic adenosine-3', 5'-monophosphate (cAMP). Here we find that mutation in torsinA induces ER stress, and inhibits the cyclic adenosine-3', 5'-monophosphate (cAMP) response to the adenylate cyclase agonist forskolin. Both defective mechanins are corrected by the small molecule 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA) that alleviates ER stress. Our results link torsinA, the ER-stress-response, and cAMP-dependent signaling, and suggest 4-PBA could also be used in dystonia treatment.

It interacts physically with lamins, torsinA, emerin and protein phosphatase 1; potentially providing a pivotal mechanism for transducing signals across the inner nuclear membrane. In neurons a functional protein complex is formed, comprising LAP1 and torsinA and in skeletal muscle LAP1 and emerin likewise form a protein complex. Several isoforms of LAP1 have been reported across species. However, in humans only two isoforms have been described, LAP1B and LAP1C. The latter has only recently been reported, but its physiological function and mode of action are not clear. The first TOR1AIP1 (gene encoding LAP1) mutation identified is a single nucleotide deletion resulting in a frameshift and a putative truncated LAP1B protein (Turkish mutation). This has deleterious effects associated with a specific form of muscular dystrophy. A second point mutation, affecting both human LAP1 isoforms, was also recently described. This mutation involves the replacement of a single glutamic acid to alanine at position 482 (Moroccan Mutation), thereby causing severe dystonia, cerebellar atrophy and cardiomyopathy. This review focuses on the recently described human LAP1 isoform (LAP1C), the two recently reported LAP1 mutations and post-translational LAP1 modifications.

Recent cloning of the gene responsible for this disease, TOR1A (DYT1), identified the encoded protein, torsinA, as a member of the AAA+ superfamily of chaperone proteins and revealed highest levels of expression in dopaminergic neurons in human brain. Most cases of this disease are caused by a deletion of one glutamic acid residue in the C-terminal region of the protein. Antibodies generated against torsinA revealed expression of a predominant immunoreactive protein species similar to the predicted size of 37.8 kDa in neural, glial and fibroblastic lines by western blot analysis. This protein is N-glycosylated with high mannose content and not, apparently, phosphoryl-ated. Overexpression of torsinA in mouse neural CAD cells followed by immunocytochemistry, revealed a dramatically different pattern of distribution for wild-type and mutant forms of the protein. The wild-type protein was found throughout the cytoplasm and neurites with a high degree of co-localization with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) marker, protein disulfide isomerase. In contrast, the mutant protein accumulated in multiple, large inclusions in the cytoplasm around the nucleus. These inclusions were composed of membrane whorls, apparently derived from the ER.

"""21496605""","""Nonprimary dystonias.""","""Dystonias can be classified as primary or secondary, as dystonia-plus syndromes, and as heredodegenerative dystonias. Their prevalence is difficult to determine. In our experience 80-90% of all dystonias are primary. About 20-30% of those have a genetic background; 10-20% are secondary, with tardive dystonia and dystonia in cerebral palsy being the most common forms. If dystonia in spastic conditions is accepted as secondary dystonia, this is the most common form of all dystonia. In primary dystonias, the dystonic movements are the only symptoms. In secondary dystonias, dystonic movements result from exogenous processes directly or indirectly affecting brain parenchyma. They may be caused by focal and diffuse brain damage, drugs, chemical agents, physical interactions with the central nervous system, and indirect central nervous system effects. Dystonia-plus syndromes describe brain parenchyma processes producing predominantly dystonia together with other movement disorders. They include dopa-responsive dystonia and myoclonus-dystonia. Heredodegenerative dystonias are dystonic movements occurring in the context of other heredodegenerative disorders. They may be caused by impaired energy metabolism, impaired systemic metabolism, storage of noxious substances, oligonucleotid repeats and other processes. Pseudodystonias mimic dystonia and include psychogenic dystonia and various orthopedic, ophthalmologic, vestibular, and traumatic conditions. Unusual manifestations, unusual age of onset, suspect family history, suspect medical history, and additional signs may indicate nonprimary dystonia. If they are suspected, etiological clarification becomes necessary. Unfortunately, potential etiologies are legion. Diagnostic algorithms can be helpful. Treatment of nonprimary dystonias, with few exceptions, does not differ from treatment of primary dystonias. The most effective treatment for focal and segmental dystonias is local botulinum toxin injections. Deep brain stimulation of the globus pallidus internus is effective for generalized dystonia. Antidystonic drugs, including anticholinergics, tetrabenazine, clozapine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor agonists, are less effective and often produce adverse effects. Dopamine is extremely effective in dopa-responsive dystonia. The Bertrand procedure can be effective in cervical dystonia. Other peripheral surgery, including myotomy, myectomy, neurotomy, rhizotomy, ramizectomy, and accessory nerve neurolysis, has largely been abandoned. Central surgery other than deep brain stimulation is obsolete. Adjuvant therapies, including orthoses, physiotherapy, ergotherapy, behavioral therapy, social support, and support groups, may be helpful.

Awareness of the diverse etiologic categories of childhood-onset dystonia is necessary to accurate diagnosis approach. Clinical examination and cerebral magnetic resonance imaging are the keys of this diagnosis approach. Primary dystonia is defined as syndromes in which dystonia is the sole phenotypic manifestation (especially no cognitive deterioration is observed, and brain MRI is normal); DYT1 dystonia, in which the abnormal gene is located on chromosome 9, is the most frequent childhood-onset primary dystonia; progressive generalisation of the abnormal movements occur in 70p.cent of the patients. Dopa - Responsive Dystonia are characterized by marked diurnal fluctuations of the dystonic symptoms and by their marked and sustained response to dopaminergic therapy; associated parkinsonian signs are usually observed later in the course of the disease. Clinical presentation of DRD might be atypical (mimicking cerebral palsy or isolated limb pain without diurnal fluctuation). DRD is rare, but a trial of L-dopa should be performed on all patients with childhood-onset dystonia, lasting at least one month. Secondary dystonias or heredodegenerative diseases are the most frequent etiology of childhood-onset dystonic syndromes. Among a huge range of heredodegenerative disease, those that are amenable to a specific treatment, such as Wilson's disease or creatine deficiency, should be particularly investigated.

"""17956903""","""Motor deficits and hyperactivity in cerebral cortex-specific Dyt1 conditional knockout mice.""","""DYT1 dystonia is a primary generalized early-onset torsion dystonia caused by mutations in DYT1 that codes for torsinA and has an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern with approximately 30% penetrance. Abnormal activity in the pallidal-thalamic-cortical circuit, especially in the globus pallidus internus, is the proposed cause of dystonic symptoms. However, recent neuroimaging studies suggest significant contribution of the cerebral cortex. To understand the contribution of the cerebral cortex to dystonia, we produced cerebral cortex-specific Dyt1 conditional knockout mice and analysed their behaviour. The conditional knockout mice exhibited motor deficits and hyperactivity that mimic the reported behavioural deficits in Dyt1 DeltaGAG knockin heterozygous and Dyt1 knockdown mice. Although the latter two mice exhibit lower levels of dopamine metabolites in the striatum, the conditional knockout mice did not show significant alterations in the striatal dopamine and its metabolites levels. The conditional knockout mice had well-developed whisker-related patterns in somatosensory cortex, suggesting formations of synapses and neural circuits were largely unaffected. The results suggest that the loss of torsinA function in the cerebral cortex alone is sufficient to induce behavioural deficits associated with Dyt1 DeltaGAG knockin mutation. Developing drugs targeting the cerebral cortex may produce novel medical treatments for DYT1 dystonia patients.""",21,"[[""patients""], [""mice""], [""dystonia""], [""hyperactivity""], [""mice""], [""dopamine""], [""dystonic symptoms""], [""torsinA""], [""DYT1""], [""hyperactivity""], [""dystonic symptoms""], [""Dyt1""], [""DYT1""], [""patients""], [""torsinA""], [""Dyt1""], [""mice""], [""mice""], [""dopamine""], [""torsion dystonia""], [""Motor deficits""]]"

Most cases of this dominantly inherited movement disorder are caused by deletion of a glutamic acid in the carboxyl terminal region of torsinA. We used a sensitive reporter, Gaussia luciferase (Gluc) to evaluate the role of torsinA in processing proteins through the ER. In primary fibroblasts from controls and DYT1 patients most Gluc activity (95%) was released into the media and processed through the secretory pathway, as confirmed by inhibition with brefeldinA and nocodazole. Fusion of Gluc to a fluorescent protein revealed coalignment and fractionation with ER proteins and association of Gluc with torsinA. Notably, fibroblasts from DYT1 patients were found to secrete markedly less Gluc activity as compared with control fibroblasts. This decrease in processing of Gluc in DYT1 cells appear to arise, at least in part, from a loss of torsinA activity, because mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking torsinA also had reduced secretion as compared with control cells. These studies demonstrate the exquisite sensitivity of this reporter system for quantitation of processing through the secretory pathway and support a role for torsinA as an ER chaperone protein.""",21,"[[""patients""], [""glutamic acid""], [""mouse""], [""movement disorder""], [""nocodazole""], [""dystonia""], [""torsinA""], [""DYT1""], [""nocodazole""], [""DYT1""], [""patients""], [""torsinA""], [""DYT1""], [""torsinA""], [""mouse""], [""torsion dystonia""], [""torsinA""], [""TorsinA""], [""Gaussia luciferase""], [""Gluc""], [""brefeldinA""]]"

Striatal cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) are essential in regulating striatal motor circuits. Multiple dystonia rodent models, including KI mice, show altered ChI firing and modulation. However, due to the errors in assigning KI mice, it is essential to replicate these findings in genetically confirmed KI mice. Here, we found irregular and decreased spontaneous firing frequency in the acute brain slices from <i>Dyt1</i> KI mice. Quinpirole, a D2R agonist, showed less inhibitory effect on the spontaneous ChI firing in <i>Dyt1</i> KI mice, suggesting decreased D2R function on the striatal ChIs. On the other hand, a muscarinic receptor agonist, muscarine, inhibited the ChI firing in both wild-type (WT) and <i>Dyt1</i> KI mice. Trihexyphenidyl, a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M1 antagonist, had no significant effect on the firing. Moreover, the resting membrane property and functions of hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels, μ-opioid receptors, and large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channels were unaffected in <i>Dyt1</i> KI mice.

After an average follow-up of 3.3 years (overall disease duration 8.6 years), partial (19%) or complete (8%) remission had occurred in a minority of patients. The fixed postures affected predominantly the limbs (90%), and rarely the neck/shoulder region (6%) or jaw (4%). In the prospectively studied group, pain was present in most patients and was a major complaint in 41%. Twenty percent of patients fulfilled criteria for Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS). No consistent investigational abnormalities were found and no patient tested (n = 25) had a mutation in the DYT1 gene. Thirty-seven percent of patients fulfilled classification criteria for documented or clinically established psychogenic dystonia; 29% fulfilled DSM-IV (Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, 4th edition) criteria for somatization disorder, which was diagnosed only after examination of the primary care records in many cases; and 24% fulfilled both sets of criteria. Ten percent of the prospectively studied and 45% of the retrospectively studied patients did not have any evidence of psychogenic dystonia, and detailed investigation failed to reveal an alternative explanation for their clinical presentation. Detailed, semi-structured neuropsychiatric assessments in a subgroup of 26 patients with fixed dystonia and in a control group of 20 patients with classical dystonia revealed dissociative (42 versus 0%, P = 0.001) and affective disorders (85 versus 50%, P = 0.01) significantly more commonly in the fixed dystonia group. Medical and surgical treatment was largely unsuccessful. However, seven patients who underwent multidisciplinary treatment, including physiotherapy and psychotherapy, experienced partial or complete remission. We conclude that fixed dystonia usually, but not always, occurs after a peripheral injury and overlaps with CRPS. Investigations are typically normal, but many patients fulfil strict criteria for a somatoform disorder/psychogenic dystonia. In a proportion of patients, however, no conclusive features of somatoform disorder or psychogenic disorder can be found and, in these patients, whether this disorder is primarily neurological or psychiatric remains an open question. Whilst the prognosis is overall poor, remissions do occur, particularly in those patients who are willing and able to undergo multidisciplinary treatment including physiotherapy and psychotherapy, suggesting that this type of treatment should be recommended to these patients.""",21,"[[""patients""], [""patient""], [""pain""], [""patients""], [""dystonia""], [""jaw""], [""mental disorders""], [""psychogenic dystonia""], [""dystonia""], [""Complex Regional Pain Syndrome""], [""neurological or psychiatric""], [""patients""], [""psychogenic dystonia""], [""peripheral injury""], [""DYT1""], [""psychogenic disorder""], [""patients""], [""somatoform disorder""], [""patient""], [""CRPS""], [""somatization disorder""]]"

Nevertheless, SD is currently an under-recognized and undertreated condition, partly due to the lack of a standard definition and because it can be the acute complicated course of both primary and secondary dystonias. In subjects with SD, due to  the delay of identification and  lacking prevention of trigger and precipitant factors, intensive care management is consistently required. OBJECTIVES:We performed a critical review of this topic, outlining clinical features and linked genetic disorders to recognize subject at higher risk of SD, describing precipitant and trigger factors and proposing potential pharmacological treatment strategies in order to prevent hospitalization. RESULTS:Genetic predisposition included: primary dystonias particularly in the case of  TOR1A mutation; epileptic encephalopathy such as ARX and GNAO1 genetic variants and neurodegenerative disorders as PANK2. Early recognition of SD should be oriented by the following sign and symptoms: fever, tachycardia, respiratory change, hypertension, sweating and autonomic instability, elevated serum CK. Pain, fever and dehydration are main trigger factors that have to be prevented or quickly controlled. Achieving sleep could be the first therapeutic option in those with high risk of developing SD. Recently, enteral or transdermal clonidine as safety and efficacy therapeutic alternative was proposed. CONCLUSION:Recognizing high risk children for Status dystonicus from the onset of subtle signs and avoiding trigger factors could drive towards better management avoiding intensive treatments.""",21,"[[""human"", ""patients"", ""patient"", ""infant"", ""mammalian"", ""infants"", ""boy"", ""child"", ""woman"", ""humans"", ""children"", ""girl"", ""Mammal"", ""boys"", ""participants"", ""women"", ""man"", ""donor"", ""persons"", ""Men"", ""person"", ""people"", ""girls"", ""peoples"", ""participant"", ""outpatient"", ""donor variant"", ""patient variant"", ""mammalians"", ""Homo sapiens"", ""Pt"", ""Homo sapiens Linnaeus, 1758"", ""pts"", ""H. sapiens"", ""humans.

Most DYT1 dystonia patients have a heterozygous trinucleotide GAG deletion in DYT1 or TOR1A gene, with a loss of a glutamic acid residue of the protein torsinA. DYT1 dystonia patients show reduced striatal dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) binding activity. We previously reported reduced striatal D2R proteins and impaired corticostriatal plasticity in Dyt1 ΔGAG heterozygous knock-in (Dyt1 KI) mice. It remains unclear how the D2R reduction contributes to the pathogenesis of DYT1 dystonia. Recent knockout studies indicate that D2R on cholinergic interneurons (Chls) has a significant role in corticostriatal plasticity, while D2R on medium spiny neurons (MSNs) plays a minor role. To determine how reduced D2Rs on ChIs and MSNs affect motor performance, we generated ChI- or MSN-specific D2R conditional knockout mice (Drd2 ChKO or Drd2 sKO). The striatal ChIs in the Drd2 ChKO mice showed an increased firing frequency and impaired quinpirole-induced inhibition, suggesting a reduced D2R function on the ChIs. Drd2 ChKO mice had an age-dependent deficient performance on the beam-walking test similar to the Dyt1 KI mice. The Drd2 sKO mice, conversely, had a deficit on the rotarod but not the beam-walking test. Our findings suggest that D2Rs on Chls and MSNs have critical roles in motor control and balance.

TorsinA, a member of the AAA+ ATPase superfamily, is located within the lumen of the nuclear envelope (NE) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We investigated an association between torsinA and nesprin-3, which spans the outer nuclear membrane (ONM) of the NE and links it to vimentin via plectin in fibroblasts. Mouse nesprin-3alpha co-immunoprecipitated with torsinA and this involved the C-terminal region of torsinA and the KASH domain of nesprin-3alpha. This association with human nesprin-3 appeared to be stronger for torsinADeltaE than for torsinA. TorsinA also associated with the KASH domains of nesprin-1 and -2 (SYNE1 and 2), which link to actin. In the absence of torsinA, in knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), nesprin-3alpha was localized predominantly in the ER. Enrichment of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-nesprin-3 in the ER was also seen in the fibroblasts of DYT1 patients, with formation of YFP-positive globular structures enriched in torsinA, vimentin and actin. TorsinA-null MEFs had normal NE structure, but nuclear polarization and cell migration were delayed in a wound-healing assay, as compared with wild-type MEFs. These studies support a role for torsinA in dynamic interactions between the KASH domains of nesprins and their protein partners in the lumen of the NE, with torsinA influencing the localization of nesprins and associated cytoskeletal elements and affecting their role in nuclear and cell movement.""",20,"[[""patients""], [""human""], [""mouse""], [""movement disorder""], [""Mouse""], [""vimentin""], [""torsinA""], [""plectin""], [""DYT1""], [""patients""], [""torsinA""], [""torsinA""], [""human""], [""mouse""], [""torsion dystonia""], [""TorsinA""], [""TorsinA""], [""nesprin-3""], [""nesprin-1 and -2""], [""SYNE1 and 2""]]"

Here we found that patient fibroblasts and mouse neurons Het for this mutation showed significant differences from WT cells in several parameters revealed by infection with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV) which replicates in the nucleus and egresses out through the nuclear envelope. Using a red fluorescent protein capsid to monitor HSV infection, patient fibroblasts showed decreased viral plaque formation as compared to controls. Mouse Het neurons had a decrease in cytoplasmic, but not nuclear HSV fluorescence, and reduced numbers of capsids entering axons as compared to infected WT neurons.

Other factors contributing to variability in outcome may include body distribution, pattern of dystonia and DBS related factors such as lead placement and stimulation parameters. The responsiveness to DBS appears to vary between different monogenic forms of dystonia, with some improving more than others. The first observation in this regard was reports of superior DBS outcomes in DYT-TOR1A (DYT1) dystonia, although other studies have found no difference. Recently a subgroup with young onset DYT-TOR1A, more rapid progression and secondary worsening after effective GPi DBS, has been described. Myoclonus dystonia due to DYT-SCGE (DYT11) usually responds well to GPi DBS. Good outcomes following GPi DBS have also been documented in X-linked dystonia Parkinsonism (DYT3).

It is caused by a GAG deletion in the Tor1A gene located on chromosome 9. TorsinA, the product of the Tor1A gene, is expressed throughout the brain beginning early in embryonic development. It plays a role in the regulation of nuclear envelope-cytoskeletal interactions, and presumably nuclear translocation. Since nuclear translocation, powered by cytoskeletal traction, is critical for cell proliferation and migration, we examined whether neurogenesis and neuronal migration are affected in Tor1A-/- mouse brain. Our data show that interkinetic nuclear migration and the pattern of migration of newly generated neurons are impaired in the dorsal forebrain of the Tor1A-/- embryo. However, neurogenesis is not altered significantly. The rate of migration of cells from explants of the medial ganglionic eminence is also impaired in the Tor1A-/- embryo. Thus, loss of torsinA results in subtle but significant alterations in cell proliferation and migration in the embryonic forebrain.

Functional alterations in basal ganglia circuits and the cerebellum have been reported in dystonia. Pharmacological manipulations or mutations in genes that result in functional alterations of the cerebellum have been reported to have dystonic symptoms and have been used as phenotypic rodent models. Additionally, structural lesions in the abnormal cerebellar circuits, such as cerebellectomy, have therapeutic effects in these models. A previous study has shown that the Dyt1 ΔGAG heterozygous knock-in (KI) mice exhibit motor deficits in the beam-walking test. Both Dyt1 ΔGAG heterozygous knock-in (KI) and Dyt1 Purkinje cell-specific knockout (Dyt1 pKO) mice exhibit dendritic alterations of cerebellar Purkinje cells. Here, Dyt1 pKO mice exhibited significantly less slip numbers in the beam-walking test, suggesting better motor performance than control littermates, and normal gait. Furthermore, Dyt1 ΔGAG KI/Dyt1 pKO double mutant mice exhibited significantly lower numbers of slips than Dyt1 ΔGAG heterozygous KI mice, suggesting Purkinje-cell specific knockout of Dyt1 wild-type (WT) allele in Dyt1 ΔGAG heterozygous KI mice rescued the motor deficits.

Assessment should be performed using a validated rating scale for dystonia. Genetic testing may be performed after establishing the clinical diagnosis. DYT1 testing is recommended for patients with primary dystonia with limb onset before age 30, and in those with an affected relative with early-onset dystonia. DYT6 testing is recommended in early-onset or familial cases with cranio-cervical dystonia or after exclusion of DYT1. Individuals with early-onset myoclonus should be tested for mutations in the DYT11 gene. If direct sequencing of the DYT11 gene is negative, additional gene dosage is required to improve the proportion of mutations detected. A levodopa trial is warranted in every patient with early-onset primary dystonia without an alternative diagnosis. In patients with idiopathic dystonia, neurophysiological tests can help with describing the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the disorder.<h4>Treatment</h4>botulinum toxin (BoNT) type A is the first-line treatment for primary cranial (excluding oromandibular) or cervical dystonia; it is also effective on writing dystonia. BoNT/B is not inferior to BoNT/A in cervical dystonia. Pallidal deep brain stimulation (DBS) is considered a good option, particularly for primary generalized or cervical dystonia, after medication or BoNT have failed.

In addition, although emphasis has been placed on dominant isolated dystonia, the disorder is also transmitted as a recessive trait, for which no mutations have been defined. Using whole-exome sequencing in a recessive isolated dystonia-affected kindred, we identified disease-segregating compound heterozygous mutations in COL6A3, a collagen VI gene associated previously with muscular dystrophy. Genetic screening of a further 367 isolated dystonia subjects revealed two additional recessive pedigrees harboring compound heterozygous mutations in COL6A3. Strikingly, all affected individuals had at least one pathogenic allele in exon 41, including an exon-skipping mutation that induced an in-frame deletion. We tested the hypothesis that disruption of this exon is pathognomonic for isolated dystonia by inducing a series of in-frame deletions in zebrafish embryos. Consistent with our human genetics data, suppression of the exon 41 ortholog caused deficits in axonal outgrowth, whereas suppression of other exons phenocopied collagen deposition mutants. All recessive mutation carriers demonstrated early-onset segmental isolated dystonia without muscular disease. Finally, we show that Col6a3 is expressed in neurons, with relevant mRNA levels detectable throughout the adult mouse brain.

In this study, the intracellular localization and levels of endogenous torsin were evaluated in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells following differentiation and stress. TorsinA, apparent MW 37 kDa, cofractionates with markers for the microsomal/endoplasmic reticulum (ER) compartment and appears to reside primarily within the ER lumen based on protease resistance. TorsinA immunoreactivity colocalizes with the lumenal ER protein protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) and extends throughout neurites. Levels of torsinA did not increase notably in response to nerve growth factor-induced differentiation. None of the stress conditions tested, including heat shock and the unfolded protein response, affected torsinA, except for oxidative stress, which resulted in an increase in the apparent MW of torsinA and redistribution to protrusions from the cell surface. These findings are consistent with a relatively rapid covalent modification of torsinA in response to oxidative stress causing a change in state. Mutant torsinA may interfere with and/or compromise ER functions, especially in dopaminergic neurons, which have high levels of torsinA and are intrinsically vulnerable to oxidative stress.""",19,"[[""human""], [""rat""], [""shock""], [""rat""], [""pheochromocytoma""], [""protein disulfide isomerase""], [""PDI""], [""neuronal dysfunction""], [""GAG""], [""neurologic disorder""], [""torsinA""], [""human""], [""shock""], [""DYT1""], [""PC12""], [""PC12""], [""torsion dystonia""], [""TorsinA""], [""TorsinA""]]"

"""23622412""","""Progressive dystonia.""","""Progressive dystonias are a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of movement disorders. In the primary forms, dystonia is the only sign of the disease, and the cause is either unknown or genetic. In the secondary forms, dystonia is usually only one of several disease manifestations and the cause may be genetic or due to other insults. Monogenic defects have been found to underlie many forms of dystonia syndromes, which are designated DYT1-20. Dystonias with known genes include DYT1 and DYT6 dystonia, presenting as isolated torsion dystonia, as well as DYT5 (dopa-responsive dystonia), DYT11 (myoclonus-dystonia), and DYT12 (rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism), where dystonia occurs in conjunction with other types of movement disorders. All of these conditions follow an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance, usually develop in childhood or early adolescence, and show an initially progressive course with stabilization in early adulthood. In secondary dystonias, there are often atypical features and additional neurological signs, such as prominent tongue and perioral involvement, pyramidal signs, ataxia, oculomotor abnormalities, or cognitive disturbances. Acquired brain lesions typically affect the putamen, thalamus, or globus pallidus and cause contralateral hemidystonia. Dystonia can be part of the clinical syndrome in many heredodegenerative disorders, or may be drug-induced or psychogenic.""",18,"[[""Movement Disorders""], [""dystonia""], [""ataxia""], [""cognitive disturbances""], [""dystonia-parkinsonism""], [""oculomotor abnormalities""], [""DYT12""], [""dystonias""], [""myoclonus-dystonia""], [""dystonia syndromes""], [""dopa-responsive dystonia""], [""heredodegenerative disorders""], [""DYT11""], [""DYT1""], [""DYT6""], [""DYT5""], [""DYT1-20""], [""contralateral hemidystonia""]]"

OBJECTIVE: To summarize current knowledge about movement disorders overrepresented among patients of Jewish ancestry. EVIDENCE REVIEW: We searched PubMed and the OMIM and Israeli National Genetic Databases for articles published from 1969 through March 31, 2014, using the search terms Parkinson's disease,movement disorders, ataxia, dystonia, chorea, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob with and Jewish. The final reference list was generated by giving priority to articles directly related to the topic, articles with the latest information, and comprehensive but relevant reviews. FINDINGS: About one-third of patients with sporadic Parkinson disease (PD) and more than 40% of patients with familial PD of Ashkenazi Jewish descent likely carry the G2019S mutation in the LRRK2 gene, a mutation in the glucocerebrosidase (GBA) gene, or both. This finding contrasts with only a 10% frequency of these mutations in patients with PD who are of non-Jewish ancestry. A dystonia due to a TOR1A gene mutation is responsible for most early-onset autosomal dominant dystonia, and 90% of Ashkenazi Jews who develop early-onset disease have TOR1A-related dystonia. Familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis tend to cluster among Jews of North African descent, and Machado-Joseph disease is particularly frequent in Yemenite Jews. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Genetic forms of PD are much more common in patients of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry with sporadic and familial PD than in the non-Jewish population.

We reviewed controlled studies on possible environmental risk factors for primary early- and late-onset dystonia. Environmental factors associated with primary early-onset dystonia are poorly understood. Early childhood illnesses have been reported to be more frequent in patients with DYT1 dystonia than in subjects carrying the DYT1 mutation that did not manifest dystonia, thus raising the possibility that such exposures precipitate dystonia among DYT1 carriers. Conversely, several environmental factors have been associated with primary adult-onset focal dystonias compared to control subjects. Namely, eye diseases, sore throat, idiopathic scoliosis, and repetitive upper limb motor action seem to be associated with blepharospasm (BSP), laryngeal dystonia (LD), cervical dystonia (CD), and upper limb dystonia, respectively. In addition, an inverse association between coffee drinking and BSP has been observed in both case-unrelated control and family-based case-control studies. Additional evidence supporting a causal link with different forms of primary late-onset dystonia is only available for diseases of the anterior segment of the eye, writing activity, and coffee intake.

Its severity also correlated with the dosage of Tor1a/TOR1A mutation. We assessed the role of excess Lipin activity in the neurological dysfunction of Tor1a disease mouse models by interbreeding these with Lpin1 knock-out mice. Genetic reduction of Lpin1 improved the survival of recessive Tor1a disease-model mice, alongside suppressing neurodegeneration, motor dysfunction, and nuclear membrane pathology.

Most cases are caused by loss of a glutamic acid residue in the AAA+ chaperone protein, torsinA, encoded in the DYT1 gene. In this study, torsinA was found to move in conjunction with vimentin in three cell culture paradigms-recovery from microtubule depolymerization, expression of a dominant-negative form of kinesin light chain and respreading after trypsinization. Co-immune precipitation studies revealed association between vimentin and torsinA in a complex including other cytoskeletal elements, actin and tubulin, as well as two proteins previously shown to interact with torsinA-the motor protein, kinesin light chain 1, and the nuclear envelope protein, LAP1. Morphologic and functional differences related to vimentin were noted in primary fibroblasts from patients carrying this DYT1 mutation as compared with controls, including an increased perinuclear concentration of vimentin and a delayed rate of adhesion to the substratum. Overexpression of mutant torsinA inhibited neurite extension in human neuroblastoma cells, with torsinA and vimentin immunoreactivity enriched in the perinuclear region and in cytoplasmic inclusions. Collectively, these studies suggest that mutant torsinA interferes with cytoskeletal events involving vimentin, possibly by restricting movement of these particles/filaments, and hence may affect development of neuronal pathways in the brain.""",18,"[[""patients""], [""glutamic acid""], [""human""], [""movement disorder""], [""neuronal loss""], [""autosomal dominant syndrome""], [""neuroblastoma""], [""vimentin""], [""LAP1""], [""Dystonia""], [""DYT1""], [""patients""], [""kinesin light chain 1""], [""torsinA""], [""human""], [""neuroblastoma""], [""torsion dystonia""], [""torsinA""]]"

There is evidence that dysfunction of striatal parvalbumin-reactive (Parv+) fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) can be involved in dystonic signs. To elucidate the relevance of these GABAergic interneurons in the pathophysiology of DYT1 dystonia, we used in vivo optogenetics to specifically inhibit Parv+ and to detect changes in motor behavior and neuronal activity. Optogenetic fibers were bilaterally implanted into the dorsal striatum of male DYT1 KI mice and wild-type (WT) littermates expressing halorhodopsin (eNpHR3.0) in Parv+ interneurons. While stimulations with yellow light pulses for up to 60 min at different pulse durations and interval lengths did not induce abnormal movements, such as dystonic signs, immunohistochemical examinations revealed genotype-dependent differences. In contrast to WT mice, stimulated DYT1 KI showed decreased striatal neuronal activity, that is, less c-Fos reactive neurons, and increased activation of cholinergic interneurons after optogenetic inhibition of Parv+ interneurons. These findings suggest an involvement of Parv+ interneurons in an impaired striatal network in DYT1 KI mice, but at least short-term inhibition of these GABAergic interneurons is not sufficient to trigger a dystonic phenotype, similar to previously shown optogenetic activation of cholinergic interneurons.""",18,"[[""human""], [""mice""], [""dystonia""], [""mice""], [""dystonic""], [""c-Fos""], [""DYT1""], [""Parv""], [""Parv""], [""parvalbumin""], [""TOR1A""], [""dystonic""], [""human""], [""mice""], [""mice""], [""torsion dystonia""], [""DYT1""], [""subtle sensorimotor deficits""]]"

Finally, in support of the in vivo results, we also provide evidence of an impaired PF synaptogenesis in a co-culture system. Of note, these alterations were rescued and in part over-compensated in the adult age in both mouse strains, suggesting that torsinA dysfunction can induce an altered maturation of cerebellar synaptic contacts. Altogether these results indicate that a loss of function of torsinA during cerebellar synaptogenesis induces important developmental alterations, that might contribute to the age-dependent susceptibility to develop dystonia in mutation carriers.""",18,"[[""human""], [""mouse""], [""mice""], [""mouse""], [""dystonia""], [""dystonia""], [""DYT1""], [""Tor1a""], [""Tor1a""], [""autosomal-dominant movement disorder""], [""hMT""], [""human""], [""mouse""], [""mice""], [""torsinA dysfunction""], [""torsion dystonia""], [""DYT1""], [""neuronal functional abnormalities""]]"

This mutation is responsible for approximately 70% of cases of early-onset primary torsion dystonia. The function of wildtype torsinA is still unknown, and it is unsolved how the deletion in the DYT1 gene contributes to the development of the disease. To better understand the molecular processes involved in torsinA pathology, we used genome-wide oligonucleotide microarrays to characterize gene expression patterns in the striatum of mouse models overexpressing the human wildtype and mutant torsinA. By this approach we were able to detect gene expression changes that seem to be specific for torsinA pathology. We found an impact of torsinA, independent from genotype, on vesicle trafficking, exocytosis, and neurotransmitter release in our mouse model. In addition, we were able to identify several new pathways and processes involved in the development of the nervous system that are affected by wildtype and mutant torsinA. Furthermore, we have striking evidence from our gene expression data that glutamate receptor mediated synaptic plasticity in the striatum is the affected underlying cellular process for impaired motor learning in human ΔGAG torsinA transgenic mice.""",18,"[[""human""], [""mouse""], [""human""], [""mouse""], [""transgenic mice""], [""oligonucleotide""], [""torsinA""], [""DYT1""], [""impaired motor learning""], [""neurodevelopmental movement disorder""], [""torsinA""], [""torsinA""], [""human""], [""mouse""], [""transgenic""], [""primary torsion dystonia""], [""torsinA""], [""Primary torsion dystonia""]]"

The DYT1 protein product, torsinA, belongs to the AAA+ family of proteins. When overexpressed, wild-type torsinA localizes mainly to the endoplasmic reticulum, whereas the mutant forms inclusions of unclear biogenetic origin. In this study, overexpressed wild-type torsinA in human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cell lines was distributed throughout the cell body and colocalized with a marker for the endoplasmic reticulum, confirming it is an endoplasmic reticulum protein. However, mutant torsinA showed perinuclear staining and formed distinct globular inclusions, which did not colocalize with endoplasmic reticulum markers. Immunoelectron microscopy of the mutant torsinA inclusions revealed membrane whorls staining for torsinA, as well as labeling of lamellae, isolated bilayers, and perinuclear membranes. This finding shows that mutant torsinA redistributes to specific membranous structures, which may represent different stages of maturation of the intracellular inclusions. The mutant torsinA-containing bodies were immunoreactive for vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2). VMAT2 expression is important for the exocytosis of bioactive monoamines in neurons. Abnormal processing, transport, or entrapment of VMAT2 within the mutant torsinA membranous inclusions, therefore, may affect cellular dopamine release, providing a potential pathogenic mechanism for the DYT1-dependent dystonia.""",18,"[[""human""], [""human""], [""dystonia""], [""dopamine""], [""neuroblastoma""], [""GAG""], [""VMAT2""], [""monoamines""], [""DYT1""], [""torsinA""], [""human""], [""neuroblastoma""], [""dopamine""], [""SH-SY5Y""], [""primary torsion dystonia""], [""torsinA""], [""SH-SY5Y""], [""vesicular monoamine transporter 2""]]"

"""20301665""","""DYT1 Early-Onset Isolated Dystonia""","""<h4>Clinical characteristics</h4>DYT1 early-onset isolated dystonia typically presents in childhood or adolescence and only on occasion in adulthood. Dystonic muscle contractions causing posturing or irregular tremor of a leg or arm are the most common presenting findings. Dystonia is usually first apparent with specific actions such as writing or walking. Over time, the contractions frequently (but not invariably) become evident with less specific actions and spread to other body regions. No other neurologic abnormalities are present. Disease severity varies considerably even within the same family. Isolated writer's cramp may be the only sign.<h4>Diagnosis/testing</h4>The diagnosis of DYT1 dystonia is established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous TOR1A pathogenic variant on molecular genetic testing. A TOR1A three base-pair deletion, c.907_909delGAG, is identified in most affected individuals.<h4>Management</h4>Treatment of manifestations: Oral medications, either alone or in combination, are usually tried first, including anticholinergics, baclofen, benzodiazepines, and others. Botulinum toxin injections for treatment of focal symptoms can be used in conjunction with oral medications. If oral medications and botulinum toxin injections do not provide sufficient control of symptoms, surgery enabling deep-brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus interna (GPi) should be considered. Prevention of secondary complications: Aggressive medical and surgical intervention to prevent contractures of the joints and deformities of the spine. Surveillance: Follow up with a neurologist specializing in movement disorders several times a year. Agents/circumstances to avoid: The extremities affected by dystonia should not be placed in a brace or cast, unless medically necessary, as this can worsen the dystonia.<h4>Genetic counseling</h4>DYT1 dystonia is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner with reduced penetrance. Offspring of an affected individual or of an asymptomatic individual known to have a TOR1A pathogenic variant have a 50% chance of inheriting the variant and if inherited a 30% chance of developing clinical findings. Once the TOR1A c.907_909delGAG deletion has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing for DYT1 dystonia are possible.""",17,"[[""tremor""], [""dystonia""], [""movement disorders""], [""Dystonia""], [""baclofen""], [""deformities""], [""benzodiazepines""], [""neurologic abnormalities""], [""contractures of the joints""], [""contractures of the joints""], [""TOR1A""], [""isolated dystonia""], [""DYT1""], [""DYT1""], [""DYT1 dystonia""], [""Dystonic muscle contractions""], [""c.907_909delGAG""]]"
"""12652041""","""Deep brain stimulation for dystonia in adults. Overview and developments.""","""The renaissance of functional neurosurgery in the treatment of Parkinson's disease has sparked also the interest in other movement disorders which are refractory to medical treatment. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been used only since a few years in dystonia patients. This review summarizes the available data on pallidal and thalamic DBS for various dystonic syndromes. The major advantage of DBS as compared to radiofrequency lesioning is that it allows performing contemporaneous bilateral surgery with relatively low morbidity in these patients. The posteroventral lateral globus pallidus internus (GPi) has been the preferred target in most instances, thus far. While phasic dystonic movements may improve early after surgery, the response of tonic dystonic movements to chronic stimulation may be delayed. The most beneficial results have been achieved in patients with primary genetic generalized and segmental dystonia, myoclonic dystonia, and complex cervical dystonia. Outcome has been varied in patients with other dystonic disorders, in particular those with secondary dystonia. Most studies have reported on relatively short follow-up periods, on single cases, or were retrospective. Pallidal DBS has been shown to be effective in complex cervical dystonia yielding both symptomatic and functional benefit for up to 2.5 years of follow-up. Dramatic improvement has been obtained in children and in adults with DYT1 positive dystonia. Also, patients with non DYT1 genetic dystonia achieved sustained benefit for up to 2 years of follow-up. Preliminary experience indicates that choreoathetosis in patients with cerebral palsy responds less well to pallidal DBS, and that it may not be effective at all in some patients. In single instances unilateral pallidal DBS has been shown to yield valuable benefit in patients with hemidystonia. The experience with DBS for treatment of Meige syndrome and other focal dystonias has been explored only recently. There is much less experience with thalamic DBS for dystonia. Thalamic DBS has been shown to be effective in single cases with posttraumatic dystonia, postanoxic dystonia and paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dystonia. Future perspectives of DBS for treatment of dystonia include the development of new technology, the evaluation of the possible role of other targets, and carefully planned studies to further establish the role of surgery.""",17,"[[""human"", ""patients"", ""patient"", ""infant"", ""mammalian"", ""infants"", ""boy"", ""child"", ""woman"", ""humans"", ""children"", ""girl"", ""Mammal"", ""boys"", ""participants"", ""women"", ""man"", ""donor"", ""persons"", ""Men"", ""person"", ""people"", ""girls"", ""peoples"", ""participant"", ""outpatient"", ""donor variant"", ""patient variant"", ""mammalians"", ""Homo sapiens"", ""Pt"", ""Homo sapiens Linnaeus, 1758"", ""pts"", ""H. sapiens"", ""humans.

Molecularly, it is characterized by hyper-induction of phosphorylation of extracellular signal-related kinase in response to dopamine in medium spiny neurons of the direct pathway.<h4>Objectives</h4>The objective of this study was to determine if mouse models of monogenic dystonia exhibit molecular features of levodopa-induced dyskinesia.<h4>Methods</h4>Western blotting and quantitative immunofluorescence was used to assay baseline and/or dopamine-induced levels of the phosphorylated kinase in the striatum in mouse models of DYT1, DYT6, and DYT25 expressing a reporter in dopamine D1 receptor-expressing projection neurons. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) immunoassay and adenylyl cyclase activity assays were also performed.<h4>Results</h4>In DYT1 and DYT6 models, blocking dopamine reuptake with cocaine leads to enhanced extracellular signal-related kinase phosphorylation in dorsomedial striatal medium spiny neurons in the direct pathway, which is abolished by pretreatment with the N-methyl-d-aspartate antagonist MK-801. Phosphorylation is decreased in a model of DYT25. Levels of basal and stimulated cAMP and adenylyl cyclase activity were normal in the DYT1 and DYT6 mice and decreased in the DYT25 mice. Oxotremorine induced increased abnormal movements in the DYT1 knock-in mice.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The increased dopamine induction of extracellular signal-related kinase phosphorylation in 2 genetic types of dystonia, similar to what occurs in levodopa-induced dyskinesia, and its decrease in a third, suggests that abnormal signal transduction in response to dopamine in the postsynaptic nigrostriatal pathway might be a point of convergence for dystonia and other hyperkinetic movement disorders, potentially offering common therapeutic targets. © 2021 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.""",17,"[[""mice"", ""mouse"", ""murine"", ""transgenic mice"", ""nude mice"", ""transgenic"", ""mice (PV"", ""Mus musculus"", ""house mouse"", ""M. musculus"", ""129/sv"", ""mmu"", ""T/+ mice"", ""mice,"", ""129Sv"", ""N/+ mice"", ""mouse variant"", ""mice."", ""mouse:"", ""129 Sv"", ""TgM"", ""House Mouse subspecies"", ""Tg mice"", ""mouse strain"", ""TG"", ""mice.

Primary dystonia is defined as clinical condition characterized by dystonia as the only neurological abnormality apart from tremor. Different genetic alterations and gene loci have been mapped in familial and sporadic patients. Early onset-primary dystonia (EO-PD) is the most severe form of primary dystonia, with clinical and genetic heterogeneity. It usually starts in one body part, subsequently spreads to involve other body regions with frequent generalization. DYT1 dystonia is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait with reduced penetrance. The unique underlying mutation is a GAG deletion in the coding region of the TOR1A gene, located at chromosome 9q34. DYT16 dystonia is a novel recessive form of EO-PD, recently described in few patients, caused by mutations in the PRKRA gene located at chromosome 2q31.

In this study, small interfering RNA (siRNA) oligonucleotides were identified, which downregulate the levels of torsinA or torsinADeltaE mRNA and protein by over 65% following transfection. Transfection of siRNA for torsinA message in control fibroblasts expressing Gluc reduced levels of luciferase secretion compared with the same cells non-transfected or transfected with a non-specific siRNA. Transfection of siRNA selectively inhibiting torsinADeltaE message in DYT fibroblasts increased luciferase secretion when compared with cells non-transfected or transfected with a non-specific siRNA. Further, transduction of DYT1 cells with a lentivirus vector expressing torsinA, but not torsinB, also increased secretion. These studies are consistent with a role for torsinA as an ER chaperone affecting processing of proteins through the secretory pathway and indicate that torsinADeltaE acts to inhibit this torsinA activity.

Deletion in the DYT1 gene, encoding the torsinA protein, is responsible for this dominantly inherited disorder, which is non-degenerative and exhibits reduced penetrance among carriers. Here, we explore the hypothesis that deficits in torsinA function result in an increased vulnerability to stress associated with protein folding and processing in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where torsinA is located. Using an in vivo quantitative readout for the ER stress response, we evaluated the consequences of torsinA mutations in transgenic nematodes expressing variants of human torsinA. This analysis revealed that, normally, torsinA serves a protective function to maintain a homeostatic threshold against ER stress. Furthermore, we show that the buffering capacity of torsinA is greatly diminished by the DYT1-associated deletion or mutations that prevent its translocation to the ER, block ATPase activity, or increase the levels of torsinA in the nuclear envelope versus ER. Combinations of transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans designed to mimic clinically relevant genetic modifiers of disease susceptibility also exhibit a direct functional correlation to changes in the ER stress response. Furthermore, using mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from torsinA knockout mice, we demonstrated that loss of endogenous torsinA results in enhanced sensitivity to ER stress. This study extends our understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying dystonia, and establishes a new functional paradigm to evaluate therapeutic strategies to compensate for reduced torsinA activity in the ER as a means to restore homeostatic balance and neuronal function.""",17,"[[""human""], [""mouse""], [""mice""], [""dystonia""], [""movement disorder""], [""inherited disorder""], [""Caenorhabditis elegans""], [""torsinA""], [""DYT1""], [""torsinA""], [""torsinA""], [""human""], [""mouse""], [""mice""], [""torsion dystonia""], [""torsion dystonia""], [""torsinA""]]"

DYT1 dystonia is likely a network disorder involving multiple brain regions, particularly the basal ganglia. Tor1a conditional knockout in the striatum or cerebral cortex leads to motor deficits, suggesting the importance of corticostriatal connection in the pathogenesis of dystonia. Indeed, corticostriatal long-term depression impairment has been demonstrated in multiple targeted DYT1 mouse models. Pappas and colleagues developed a conditional knockout line (Dlx-CKO) that inactivated Tor1a in the forebrain and surprisingly displayed overt dystonia. We set out to validate whether conditional knockout affecting both cortex and striatum would lead to overt dystonia and whether machine learning-based video behavioral analysis could be used to facilitate high throughput preclinical drug screening. We generated Dlx-CKO mice and found no overt dystonia or motor deficits at 4 months. At 8 months, retesting revealed motor deficits in rotarod, beam walking, grip strength, and hyperactivity in the open field; however, no overt dystonia was visually discernible or through the machine learning-based video analysis. Consistent with other targeted DYT1 mouse models, we observed age-dependent deficits in the beam walking test, which is likely a better motor behavioral test for preclinical drug testing but more labor-intensive when overt dystonia is absent.""",17,"[[""mouse""], [""mice""], [""dystonia""], [""hyperactivity""], [""mice""], [""glutamic acid""], [""motor deficits""], [""Dlx""], [""dystonia""], [""torsinA""], [""DYT1""], [""Dlx""], [""Dyt1""], [""TOR1A""], [""Tor1a""], [""depression impairment""], [""dystonia or motor deficits""]]"

Broadening of phenotype of some of the previously described hereditary dystonias and environmental risk factors and trends in treatment will be covered.<h4>Recent findings</h4>Based on phenomenology, a new consensus update on the definition, phenomenology and classification of dystonia and a syndromic approach to guide diagnosis have been proposed. Terminology has changed and 'isolated dystonia' is used wherein dystonia is the only motor feature apart from tremor, and the previously called heredodegenerative dystonias and dystonia plus syndromes are now subsumed under 'combined dystonia'. The recently discovered genes ANO3, GNAL and CIZ1 appear not to be a common cause of adult-onset cervical dystonia. Clinical and genetic heterogeneity underlie myoclonus-dystonia, dopa-responsive dystonia and deafness-dystonia syndrome. ALS2 gene mutations are a newly recognized cause for combined dystonia. The phenotypic and genotypic spectra of ATP1A3 mutations have considerably broadened. Two new genome-wide association studies identified new candidate genes. A retrospective analysis suggested complicated vaginal delivery as a modifying risk factor in DYT1. Recent studies confirm lasting therapeutic effects of deep brain stimulation in isolated dystonia, good treatment response in myoclonus-dystonia, and suggest that early treatment correlates with a better outcome.<h4>Summary</h4>Phenotypic classification continues to be important to recognize particular forms of dystonia and this includes syndromic associations.

This autosomal dominant disease has variable penetration. It has long been recognized that some individuals in families with typical disease only have segmentary, multifocal or even focal dystonia. It has been proven by molecular genetics that the disease can be expressed simply by familial writers cramp with particularly early, and often bilateral, onset. The mutation concerns the torsine A gene, whose function remains to be elucidated. Torsine A is found in the central nervous system, particularly in the dopaminergic neurons of the locus niger. GENERALIZED PRIMARY DYSTONIA UNRELATED TO DYT-1: These dystonias are phenotypically different: younger and more variable age at onset, focal localization early in the disease course generally involving the cervical or cephalic pole, less severe course. Certain forms are linked to chromosome 8 (locus DYT 6). PRIMARY FOCAL OR SEGMENTARY DYSTONIAS: These primary dystonias cause functional or postural disorders and were long considered as sporadic despite rare familial cases suggesting a genetic factor. When searched for systematically, familial cases are found in 20 to 30% of the cases. The dystonia is transmitted by dominant autosomal heredity with reduced penetration. Phenotypically, expression is heterogeneous with a constant frequency of unrecognized or neglected forms and of postural forms. One form is known to be linked to chromosome 18 (locus DYT 7). DOPA-RESPONSIVE DYSTONIA: This class represents 5 to 10% of childhood dystonias. The phenotypic expression is polymorphous but symptoms always improve with very small doses of L-dopa. Both sporadic, and more frequently familial, cases are described. Some forms are recessive, caused by mutation of the gene coding for tyrosine hydroxylase, others are autosomal dominant, often linked to mutation of the gene coding for GTP cyclohydrolase.

Targeting the intrinsic capacities of neuroprotective proteins to restore neuronal function and/or attenuate degeneration represents a potential means toward therapeutic intervention. The product of the human DYT1 gene, torsinA, is a member of the functionally diverse AAA+ family of proteins and exhibits robust molecular-chaperone-like activity, both in vitro and in vivo. Although mutations in DYT1 are associated with a rare form of heritable generalized dystonia, the native function of torsinA seems to be cytoprotective in maintaining the cellular threshold to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Here we explore the potential for torsinA to serve as a buffer to attenuate the cellular consequences of misfolded-protein stress as it pertains to the neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The selective vulnerability of motor neurons to degeneration in ALS mouse models harboring mutations in superoxide dismutase (SOD1) has been found to correlate with regional-specific ER stress in brains. Using Caenorhabditis elegans as a system to model ER stress, we generated transgenic nematodes overexpressing either wild-type or mutant human SOD1 to evaluate their relative impact on ER stress induction in vivo. These studies revealed a mutant-SOD1-specific increase in ER stress that was further exacerbated by changes in temperature, all of which was robustly attenuated by co-expression of torsinA. Moreover, through complementary behavioral analysis, torsinA was able to restore normal neuronal function in mutant G85R SOD1 animals. Furthermore, torsinA targeted mutant SOD1 for degradation via the proteasome, representing mechanistic insight on the activity that torsinA has on aggregate-prone proteins. These results expand our understanding of proteostatic mechanisms influencing neuronal dysfunction in ALS, while simultaneously highlighting the potential for torsinA as a novel target for therapeutic development.""",15,"[[""mice"", ""mouse"", ""murine"", ""transgenic mice"", ""nude mice"", ""transgenic"", ""mice (PV"", ""Mus musculus"", ""house mouse"", ""M. musculus"", ""129/sv"", ""mmu"", ""T/+ mice"", ""mice,"", ""129Sv"", ""N/+ mice"", ""mouse variant"", ""mice."", ""mouse:"", ""129 Sv"", ""TgM"", ""House Mouse subspecies"", ""Tg mice"", ""mouse strain"", ""TG"", ""mice.

Our goal was to characterize patients with inherited and isolated dystonia and determine the frequency of mutations responsible for DYT1 and DYT6 in Brazilian patients.<h4>Methods</h4>Two movement disorder specialists examined 78 patients with idiopathic isolated dystonia using a standardized questionnaire, before sequencing TOR1A and THAP1 genes.<h4>Results</h4>Clinically, our cohort was similar to those described in the international literature. Molecular studies of 68 subjects revealed only one potentially deleterious variant in THAP1 (1/68 patients, 1.47%). This was a novel 10-bp deletion at the end of exon 1, g.5308_5317del (ng_011837.1), which is predicted to create an alternative splicing and the insertion of a premature stop codon. Although we did not observe any potentially deleterious mutations in TOR1A, we found the missense variant rs1801968 (TOR1A p.D216H), previously reported as either a modifier of dystonia phenotype or a predisposing factor for dystonia. However, we did not identify any phenotypic impact related to the missense variant rs1801968 (P = 0.3387).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Although clinically similar to most cohorts with dystonia worldwide, the classical mutation (c.907_909delGAG) in TOR1A (causing DYT1) is absent in our patients.

The cellular and regional distribution of torsinA protein, which is restricted to neuronal cells and present in all brain regions by the age of 2 months has been described recently in human developing brain. TorsinB is a member of the same family of proteins and is highly homologous with its gene adjacent to that for torsinA on chromosome 9q34. TorsinA and torsinB share several remarkable features suggesting that they may interact in vivo. This study examined the expression of torsinB in the human brain of fetuses, infants and children up to 7 years of age. Our results indicate that torsinB protein expression is temporarily and spatially regulated in a similar fashion as torsinA. Expression of torsinB protein was detectable beginning at four to 8 weeks of age in the cerebellum (Purkinje cells), substantia nigra (dopaminergic neurons), hippocampus and basal ganglia and was predominantly restricted to neuronal cells. In contrast to torsinA, torsinB immunoreactivity was found more readily in the nuclear envelope. High levels of torsinB protein were maintained throughout infancy, childhood and adulthood suggesting that torsinB is also needed for developmental events occurring in the early postnatal phase and is necessary for functional activity throughout life.""",15,"[[""human""], [""children""], [""human""], [""dystonia""], [""infants""], [""infants""], [""TOR1A""], [""DYT1""], [""torsinA""], [""human""], [""children""], [""TorsinA""], [""torsinB""], [""TorsinB""], [""TorsinB""]]"

While inclusion formation is a characteristic feature for ΔE TOR1A, elevated levels of aggregates for other mutations were not observed when compared with WT TOR1A. WT and mutant TOR1A showed preferred degradation through the autophagy-lysosome pathway, which is most pronounced for p.A14_P15del, p.R288Q, and ΔE TOR1A.

Although the p.A14_P15del mutation affects the proposed oligomerization domain of TOR1A, this mutation did not disturb the ability to dimerize.

DYT1 dystonia patients show trends of decreased striatal ligand-binding activities to dopamine receptors 1 (D1R) and 2 (D2R). Dyt1 ΔGAG knock-in (KI) mice, which have the corresponding ΔGAG deletion, similarly exhibit reduced striatal D1R and D2R-binding activities and their expression levels. While the consequences of D2R reduction have been well characterized, relatively little is known about the effect of D1R reduction. Here, locomotor responses to D1R and D2R antagonists were examined in Dyt1 KI mice. Dyt1 KI mice showed significantly less responsiveness to both D1R antagonist SCH 23390 and D2R antagonist raclopride. The electrophysiological recording indicated that Dyt1 KI mice showed a significantly increased paired-pulse ratio of the striatal D1R-expressing medium spiny neurons and altered miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents. To analyze the in vivo torsinA function in the D1R-expressing neurons further, Dyt1 conditional knockout (Dyt1 d1KO) mice in these neurons were generated. Dyt1 d1KO mice had decreased spontaneous locomotor activity and reduced numbers of slips in the beam-walking test. Dyt1 d1KO male mice showed abnormal gait. Dyt1 d1KO mice showed defective striatal D1R maturation. Moreover, the mutant striatal D1R-expressing medium spiny neurons had increased capacitance, decreased sEPSC frequency, and reduced intrinsic excitability.

Dystonia is often accompanied by pain, and neuropathic pain can be associated to peripherally induced movement disorder and dystonia. However, no evidence exists on the effect of gabapentin in mice subjected to neuropathic pain model overexpressing human normal or mutated TA.<h4>Methods</h4>Mice subjected to L5 spinal nerve ligation (SNL) develop mechanical allodynia and upregulation of the α2δ-1 L-type calcium channel subunit, forming a validated experimental model of neuropathic pain. Under these experimental conditions, TA is expressed in dorsal horn neurons and astrocytes and colocalizes with α2δ-1. Similar to this subunit, TA is overexpressed in dorsal horn 7 days after SNL. This model has been used to investigate (1) basal mechanical sensitivity; (2) neuropathic pain phases; and (3) the effect of gabapentin, an α2δ-1 ligand used against neuropathic pain, in non-transgenic (NT) C57BL/6 mice and in mice overexpressing human wild-type (hWT) or mutant (hMT) TA.<h4>Results</h4>In comparison to non-transgenic mice, the threshold for mechanical sensitivity in hWT or hMT does not differ (Kruskal-Wallis test = 1.478; <i>p</i> = 0.4777, although, in the latter animals, neuropathic pain recovery phase is delayed. Interestingly, gabapentin (100 mg/Kg) reduces allodynia at its peak (occurring between post-operative day 7 and day 10) but not in the phase of recovery.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These data lend support to the investigation on the role of TA in the molecular machinery engaged during neuropathic pain.""",15,"[[""mice"", ""mouse"", ""murine"", ""transgenic mice"", ""nude mice"", ""transgenic"", ""mice (PV"", ""Mus musculus"", ""house mouse"", ""M. musculus"", ""129/sv"", ""mmu"", ""T/+ mice"", ""mice,"", ""129Sv"", ""N/+ mice"", ""mouse variant"", ""mice."", ""mouse:"", ""129 Sv"", ""TgM"", ""House Mouse subspecies"", ""Tg mice"", ""mouse strain"", ""TG"", ""mice.

Recently, another Exon 5 mutation (c.863G>A) has been associated with early-onset generalized dystonia and some DeltaGAG mutation carriers present with late-onset focal dystonia. The aim of this study was to identify TOR1A Exon 5 mutations in a large cohort of subjects with mainly non-generalized primary dystonia.<h4>Methods</h4>High resolution melting (HRM) was used to examine the entire TOR1A Exon 5 coding sequence in 1014 subjects with primary dystonia (422 spasmodic dysphonia, 285 cervical dystonia, 67 blepharospasm, 41 writer's cramp, 16 oromandibular dystonia, 38 other primary focal dystonia, 112 segmental dystonia, 16 multifocal dystonia, and 17 generalized dystonia) and 250 controls (150 neurologically normal and 100 with other movement disorders). Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were evaluated in an additional 8 subjects with known DeltaGAG DYT1 dystonia and 88 subjects with DeltaGAG-negative dystonia.<h4>Results</h4>HRM of TOR1A Exon 5 showed high (100%) diagnostic sensitivity and specificity.

The most common mutation is a trinucleotide deletion (ΔGAG), which causes a deletion of a glutamic acid residue (ΔE) in the C-terminal region of torsinA. Although recent studies using cultured cells suggest that torsinA contributes to protein processing in the secretory pathway, endocytosis, and the stability of synaptic proteins, the nature of how this mutation affects synaptic transmission remains unclear. We previously reported that theta-burst-induced long-term potentiation (LTP) in the CA1 region of the hippocampal slice is not altered in Dyt1 ΔGAG heterozygous knock-in (KI) mice. Here, we examined short-term synaptic plasticity and synaptic transmission in the hippocampal slices. Field recordings in the hippocampal Schaffer collaterals (SC) pathway revealed significantly enhanced paired pulse ratios (PPRs) in Dyt1 ΔGAG heterozygous KI mice, suggesting an impaired synaptic vesicle release. Whole-cell recordings from the CA1 neurons showed that Dyt1 ΔGAG heterozygous KI mice exhibited normal miniature excitatory post-synaptic currents (mEPSC), suggesting that action-potential independent spontaneous pre-synaptic release was normal. On the other hand, there was a significant decrease in the frequency, but not amplitude or kinetics, of spontaneous excitatory post-synaptic currents (sEPSC) in Dyt1 ΔGAG heterozygous KI mice, suggesting that the action-potential dependent pre-synaptic release was impaired. Moreover, hippocampal torsinA was significantly reduced in Dyt1 ΔGAG heterozygous KI mice.

Recently, two mutations in THAP1, the gene that encodes THAP (thanatos-associated protein) domain-containing apoptosis-associated protein 1 (THAP1), have been identified as a cause of DYT6 dystonia.<h4>Methods</h4>We screened THAP1 by sequence analysis and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 160 white patients of European ancestry who had dystonia with an early age at onset (n=64), generalised dystonia (n=35), a positive family history of dystonia (n=56), or facial or laryngeal dystonia. Another 160 patients with dystonia were screened for reported and novel variants in THAP1. 280 neurologically healthy controls were screened for the newly identified and previously reported changes in THAP1 and these and an additional 75 controls were screened for a rare non-coding mutation.<h4>Findings</h4>We identified two mutations in THAP1 (388_389delTC and 474delA), respectively, in two (1%) German patients from the 160 patients with dystonia. Both mutation carriers had laryngeal dystonia that started in childhood and both went on to develop generalised dystonia. Thus, two of three patients with early-onset generalised dystonia with orobulbar involvement had mutations in THAP1. One of the identified patients with DYT6 dystonia had two family members with subtle motor signs who also carried the same mutation. A rare substitution in the 5'untranslated region (-236_235GA-->TT) was found in 20 of 320 patients and in seven of 355 controls (p=0.0054).<h4>Interpretation</h4>Although mutations in THAP1 might have only a minor role in patients with different, but mainly focal, forms of dystonia, they do seem to be associated with early-onset generalised dystonia with spasmodic dysphonia. This combination of symptoms might be a characteristic feature of DYT6 dystonia and could be useful in the differential diagnosis of DYT1, DYT4, DYT12, and DYT17 dystonia. In addition to the identified mutations, a rare non-coding substitution in THAP1 might increase the risk of dystonia.<h4>Funding</h4>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; Volkswagen Foundation; Dystonia Medical Research Foundation; University of Lübeck.""",14,"[[""human"", ""patients"", ""patient"", ""infant"", ""mammalian"", ""infants"", ""boy"", ""child"", ""woman"", ""humans"", ""children"", ""girl"", ""Mammal"", ""boys"", ""participants"", ""women"", ""man"", ""donor"", ""persons"", ""Men"", ""person"", ""people"", ""girls"", ""peoples"", ""participant"", ""outpatient"", ""donor variant"", ""patient variant"", ""mammalians"", ""Homo sapiens"", ""Pt"", ""Homo sapiens Linnaeus, 1758"", ""pts"", ""H. sapiens"", ""humans.

However, the nature of such alteration remains unclear.<h4>Objective</h4>The aim of the present work was to characterize the mechanistic basis of cholinergic dysfunction in DYT1 dystonia to identify potential targets for pharmacological intervention.<h4>Methods</h4>We utilized electrophysiology recordings, immunohistochemistry, enzymatic activity assays, and Western blotting techniques to analyze in detail the cholinergic machinery in the dorsal striatum of the Tor1a<sup>+/-</sup> mouse model of DYT1 dystonia.<h4>Results</h4>We found a significant increase in the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) protein level, the protein responsible for loading acetylcholine (ACh) from the cytosol into synaptic vesicles, which indicates an altered cholinergic tone. Accordingly, in Tor1a<sup>+/-</sup> mice we measured a robust elevation in basal ACh content coupled to a compensatory enhancement of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzymatic activity. Moreover, pharmacological activation of dopamine D2 receptors, which is expected to reduce ACh levels, caused an abnormal elevation in its content, as compared to controls. Patch-clamp recordings revealed a reduced effect of AChE inhibitors on cholinergic interneuron excitability, whereas muscarinic autoreceptor function was preserved. Finally, we tested the hypothesis that blockade of VAChT could restore corticostriatal long-term synaptic plasticity deficits. Vesamicol, a selective VAChT inhibitor, rescued a normal expression of synaptic plasticity.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Overall, our findings indicate that VAChT is a key player in the alterations of striatal plasticity and a novel target to normalize cholinergic dysfunction observed in DYT1 dystonia. © 2021 The Authors.

Abnormal nuclear envelopes have been reported in cellular and mouse models of early-onset DYT1 generalized torsion dystonia; however, the relationship between the abnormal nuclear envelopes and motor symptoms are not clear. Furthermore, it is not known whether abnormal nuclear envelope exists in non-DYT1 dystonia. In the present study, abnormal nuclear envelopes in the striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) were found in Sgce KO mice. To analyze whether the loss of ε-sarcoglycan in the striatum alone causes abnormal nuclear envelopes, motor deficits or myoclonus, we produced paternally inherited striatum-specific Sgce conditional KO (Sgce sKO) mice and analyzed their phenotypes. Sgce sKO mice exhibited motor deficits in both beam-walking and accelerated rotarod tests, while they did not exhibit abnormal nuclear envelopes, alteration in locomotion, or myoclonus. The results suggest that the loss of ε-sarcoglycan in the striatum contributes to motor deficits, while it alone does not produce abnormal nuclear envelopes or myoclonus.

The discovery of the first two gene mutations causing primary generalized dystonia (DYT1-TOR1A and DYT6-THAP1) has facilitated studies on pathogenesis and pathophysiology of primary dystonias, by comparing neurophysiology between manifesting and non-manifesting carriers, and by studying the molecular biology of the mutant gene products. During recent years, several other gene mutations causing primary dystonia, dystonia-plus, and paroxysmal dystonia disorders have been discovered. Only during the last year, by the use of whole-exome sequencing techniques, mutations in three different genes in families with predominantly cervical dystonia were found, which may lead to improved insight into the pathogenesis also of the more frequent focal dystonias. Botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) and deep brain stimulation (DBS) have revolutionized the symptomatic treatment for dystonia during the last two decades and continue to be refined to improve efficacy and expand their indications. Unfortunately, no progress has been made in the oral medication of dystonia. Current and future new insights into pathogenetic and pathophysiological mechanisms of dystonia will hopefully lead to improvement also in this area soon.""",14,"[[""dystonia""], [""Dystonia""], [""movement disorder""], [""dystonias""], [""Dystonia""], [""cervical dystonia""], [""BoNT""], [""DYT6""], [""THAP1""], [""TOR1A""], [""DYT1""], [""dystonia-plus""], [""Botulinum neurotoxin""], [""paroxysmal dystonia disorders""]]"

The coding substitutions were: c. 238A>G (p.Ile80Val), found in two patients, and c.167A>G (p.Glu56Gly), found in one patient. The same variations were present also in the patients' symptomatic as well as asymptomatic relatives. Mutation penetration in the analyzed families was 50-66.7%. In the fourth patient, a novel c.-249C>A substitution in the promoter region was identified. The patient, initially suspected of idiopathic isolated dystonia, finally presented with pantothenate kinase 2-associated neurodegeneration phenotype and was a carrier of two PANK2 mutations. This is the first identified NBIA1 case carrying mutations in both PANK2 and THAP1 genes. In all symptomatic THAP1 mutation carriers (four probands and their three affected relatives) the first signs of dystonia occurred before the age of 23. A primary localization typical for DYT6 dystonia was observed in six individuals. Five subjects developed the first signs of dystonia in the upper limb. In one patient the disease began from laryngeal involvement. An uncommon primary involvement of lower limb was noted in the THAP1 and PANK2 mutations carrier. Neither of these THAP1 substitutions were found in 150 unrelated healthy controls.

In this review, we highlight current understanding of how this mutation causes disease from research spanning structural biochemistry, cell science, neurobiology, and several model organisms. We now know that homozygosity for ΔGAG has the same effects as Tor1a<sup>KO</sup> , implicating a partial loss of function mechanism in the ΔGAG/+ disease state. In addition, torsinA loss specifically affects neurons in mice, even though the gene is broadly expressed, apparently because of differential expression of homologous torsinB. Furthermore, certain neuronal subtypes are more severely affected by torsinA loss. Interestingly, these include striatal cholinergic interneurons that display abnormal responses to dopamine in several Tor1a animal models. There is also progress on understanding torsinA molecular cell biology. The structural basis of how ΔGAG inhibits torsinA ATPase activity is defined, although mutant torsinA<sup>ΔGAG</sup> protein also displays some characteristics suggesting it contributes to dystonia by a gain-of-function mechanism. Furthermore, a consistent relationship is emerging between torsin dysfunction and membrane biology, including an evolutionarily conserved regulation of lipid metabolism.

Selective targeting of the DYT1 allele was highly efficient with most common non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) edits, leading to a predicted premature stop codon with loss of the torsinA C terminus (delta 302-332 aa). Structural analysis predicted a functionally inactive status of this truncated torsinA due to the loss of residues associated with ATPase activity and binding to LULL1. Immunoblotting showed a reduction of the torsinA protein level in Cas9-edited DYT1 fibroblasts, and a functional assay using HSV infection indicated a phenotypic recovery toward that observed in control fibroblasts.

Among the few therapeutic options, broad-spectrum antimuscarinic drugs are utilized, aimed at counteracting abnormal striatal acetylcholine-mediated transmission, which plays a crucial role in dystonia pathophysiology. We previously demonstrated a complete loss of long-term synaptic depression (LTD) at corticostriatal synapses in rodent models of two distinct forms of isolated dystonia, resulting from mutations in the TOR1A (DYT1), and GNAL (DYT25) genes. In addition to anticholinergic agents, the aberrant excitability of striatal cholinergic cells can be modulated by group I metabotropic glutamate receptor subtypes (mGlu1 and 5). Here, we tested the efficacy of the negative allosteric modulator (NAM) of metabotropic glutamate 5 (mGlu) receptor, dipraglurant (ADX48621) on striatal LTD. We show that, whereas acute treatment failed to rescue LTD, chronic dipraglurant rescued this form of synaptic plasticity both in DYT1 mice and GNAL rats. Our analysis of the pharmacokinetic profile of dipraglurant revealed a relatively short half-life, which led us to uncover a peculiar time-course of recovery based on the timing from last dipraglurant injection. Indeed, striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs) recorded within 2 h from last administration showed full expression of synaptic plasticity, whilst the extent of recovery progressively diminished when SPNs were recorded 4-6 h after treatment.

"""20350935""","""How psychogenic is dystonia? Views from past to present.""","""In the last few centuries, there has been a constant sway between organic and psychogenic explanations for dystonia. In the current study, we investigate this history, assuming the perspective of a spectrum from organic to psychogenic, between which ideas were moving. We have focussed on (i) primary generalized dystonia, (ii) cervical dystonia, (iii) writer's cramp and (iv) fixed dystonia related to complex regional pain syndrome. We have studied medical texts published since the 19th century and their references. Jean-Martin Charcot advocated the concept of hysteria, disorders in which, besides predisposition, environmental factors were involved in their pathogenesis. Sigmund Freud introduced psychoanalysis as an explanatory therapy for psychic disorders. Previous theories, together with the lack of an organic substrate for dystonia, made a strong case for psychogenic explanations. Consequently, many dystonia patients were told that they suffered from psychological conflicts and were treated for them. However, after the description of new hereditary cases in the 1950s, the limited efficacy of psychotherapy in torsion dystonia, the effects of surgical treatments and the lesion studies in the 1960s, more physicians became convinced of the organic nature. The culminating point was the discovery of the DYT1 gene in 1997. In the meantime, experts had already convinced the neurological community that cervical dystonia and writer's cramp were focal dystonias, i.e. minor forms of generalized dystonia, and therefore organic disorders. In contrast, the pathophysiology of fixed dystonia related to complex regional pain syndrome remained controversial. Knowledge of this history, which played on the border between neurology and psychiatry, is instructive and reflects the difficulty in discriminating between them. Today, new insights from functional imaging and neurophysiological studies again challenge the interpretation of these disorders, while the border between psychogenic and organic has become more blurred. Abnormalities of sensorimotor integration and cortical excitability that are currently supposed to be the underlying cause of dystonia bring us back to Sherringtonian physiology. We suggest that this may lead to a common explanation of the four afflictions of which we have traced the history.""",13,"[[""patients""], [""pain""], [""dystonia""], [""pain syndrome""], [""dystonia""], [""dystonias""], [""organic disorders""], [""cramp""], [""DYT1""], [""patients""], [""torsion dystonia""], [""psychic disorders""], [""Abnormalities of sensorimotor""]]"

What is not known is how torsinA dysfunction in these specific cell types contributes to the pathophysiology of DYT1 dystonia. In this study we sought to determine whether torsinA dysfunction in cholinergic neurons alone is sufficient to generate the sensorimotor dysfunction and brain changes associated with dystonia, or if torsinA dysfunction in a broader subset of cell types is needed. We generated two genetically modified mouse models, one with selective Dyt1 knock-out from dopamine-2 receptor expressing neurons (D2KO) and one where only cholinergic neurons are impacted (Ch2KO). We assessed motor deficits and performed in vivo 11.1 T functional MRI to assess sensory-evoked brain activation and connectivity, along with diffusion MRI to assess brain microstructure. We found that D2KO mice showed greater impairment than Ch2KO mice, including reduced sensory-evoked brain activity in key regions of the sensorimotor network, and altered functional connectivity of the striatum that correlated with motor deficits.

Medical treatment rarely relieves symptoms. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of bilateral pallidal stimulation in 6 children and adolescents with primary generalized dystonia. In addition, we strived to find predictors for treatment outcome by review and analysis of previously published studies.<h4>Methods</h4>Six patients with primary generalized dystonia underwent chronic bilateral stimulation of the globus pallidus internus. A PubMed and MEDLINE search was performed in order to identify children and adolescents who underwent deep brain stimulation for primary generalized dystonia. The primary efficacy endpoint was the relative change of the Burke-Fahn-Marsden-Dystonia-Rating-Scale (movement score) after surgery.<h4>Results</h4>Forty-four patients were found to meet the inclusion criteria. The mean age at onset of the disease was 7.8+/-2.8years and the mean age at surgery was 14.2+/-3.5years. The mean Burke-Fahn-Marsden-Dystonia-Rating-Scale (movement score) was 56.9+/-22.7 before surgery and 23.7+/-23.2 at a mean follow up of 13.0+/-4.8months (p<0.001). The improvement in the DYT1-positive group was significantly higher compared to the DYT1-negative group (77%+/-24% and 44%+/-30%, respectively, p<0.001). A positive correlation between the movement score before and after surgery was found in both the DYT1-positive and DYT1-negative cohort (rs=0.624, p<0.001 and rs=0.734, p<0.001, respectively).<h4>Conclusion</h4>DBS is an effective treatment in children and adolescents with primary generalized dystonia.

"""33502045""","""Genotype-Phenotype Relations for Isolated Dystonia Genes: MDSGene Systematic Review.""","""This comprehensive MDSGene review is devoted to 7 genes - TOR1A, THAP1, GNAL, ANO3, PRKRA, KMT2B, and HPCA - mutations in which may cause isolated dystonia. It followed MDSGene's standardized data extraction protocol and screened a total of ~1200 citations. Phenotypic and genotypic data on ~1200 patients with 254 different mutations were curated and analyzed. There were differences regarding age at onset, site of onset, and distribution of symptoms across mutation carriers in all 7 genes. Although carriers of TOR1A, THAP1, PRKRA, KMT2B, or HPCA mutations mostly showed childhood and adolescent onset, patients with GNAL and ANO3 mutations often developed first symptoms in adulthood. GNAL and KMT2B mutation carriers frequently have 1 predominant site of onset, that is, the neck (GNAL) or the lower limbs (KMT2B), whereas site of onset in DYT-TOR1A, DYT-THAP1, DYT-ANO3, DYT-PRKRA, and DYT-HPCA was broader. However, in most DYT-THAP1 and DYT-ANO3 patients, dystonia first manifested in the upper half of the body (upper limb, neck, and craniofacial/laryngeal), whereas onset in DYT-TOR1A, DYT-PRKRA and DYT-HPCA was frequently observed in an extremity, including both upper and lower ones. For ANO3, a segmental/multifocal distribution was typical, whereas TOR1A, PRKRA, KMT2B, and HPCA mutation carriers commonly developed generalized dystonia. THAP1 mutation carriers presented with focal, segmental/multifocal, or generalized dystonia in almost equal proportions. GNAL mutation carriers rarely showed generalization.

"""22132914""","""Deep brain stimulation in children: experience and technical pearls.""","""<h4>Object</h4>Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established technique for the treatment of several movement disorders in adults. However, the technical approach, complications, and results of DBS in children have not been well documented.<h4>Methods</h4>A database of DBS implantations performed at a single institution, prospectively established in 1998, was reviewed for patients who received DBS prior to the age of 18. Diagnoses, surgical technique, and complications were noted. Outcomes were assessed using standard rating scales of neurological function.<h4>Results</h4>Of 815 patients undergoing DBS implantation over a 12-year period, 31 were children (mean age at surgery 13.2 years old, range 4-17 years old). Diagnoses included the following: DYT1 primary dystonia (autosomal dominant, Tor1AΔGAG mutation, 10 cases), non-DYT1 primary dystonia (3 cases), secondary dystonia (11 cases), neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA, 3 cases), levodopa-responsive parkinsonism (2 cases), Lesch-Nyhan disease (1 case), and glutaric aciduria Type 1 (1 case). Six children ages 15-17 years old underwent awake microelectrode-guided surgery. For 25 children operated under general anesthesia, the surgical technique evolved from microelectrode-guided surgery to image-guided surgeries using real-time intraoperative MR imaging or CT for lead location confirmation. Complications included 5 hardware infections, all in children younger than 10 years old. At 1 year after implantation, patients with DYT1 dystonia had a mean improvement in the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale movement subscore of 75%, while those with secondary dystonia had only small improvements. Outcomes in the 3 children with NBIA were disappointing.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Results of DBS in children with primary and secondary dystonias were similar to those in adults, with excellent results for DYT1 dystonia in children without fixed orthopedic deformity and much more modest results in secondary dystonia. In contrast to reported experience in adults with NBIA, these results in children with NBIA were poor.

A preliminary report.""","""<h4>Background and purpose</h4>DYT1 dystonia is the most common form of inherited primary dystonia. The aim of the study was: 1) to evaluate the prevalence of the DYT1 mutation in a population of Polish patients with early-onset generalized dystonia and with other forms of familial dystonia, 2) to evaluate the frequency of the DYT1 mutation in patients with writer's cramp, 3) to characterize the phenotype of the DYT1 mutation in the Polish population, and 4) to define the group of patients in whom genetic testing is recommended.<h4>Material and methods</h4>The following groups of patients were included in the study: 1) patients with early-onset (<30 years) generalized dystonia and those patients with onset after age 30 years who have relatives with early-onset dystonia, 2) patients with writer's cramp (focal or as part of segmental dystonia) independently of age of onset, 3) asymptomatic (adult only) relatives of the diagnosed DYT1 carriers. Genetic tests were performed in 63 subjects---28 sporadic cases of dystonia, 20 patients with familial dystonia, and 15 asymptomatic relatives of patients with confirmed DYT1 mutation.<h4>Results</h4>The DYT1 mutation was found in 17 subjects--10 patients with dystonia and 7 asymptomatic relatives (from 6 families). In all mutation carriers dystonia occurred in one limb before age 26 years. In 8 patients, generalization of dystonia was observed and in 2 cases it remained in a focal form.<h4>Conclusions</h4>1. The prevalence of DYT1 mutation among patients with early-onset (<or= 24 years) dystonia was 20.8% and it was similar to that found in other European populations. 2. No DYT1 mutation was found among sporadic cases of writer's cramp. 3. In the studied group the most common was the phenotype with early onset (<or= 24 years) and the first symptoms localized in one of the limbs. 4. The obtained results confirm that the recommendations available in the literature concerning DYT1 genetic testing can be applied to the Polish population.""",13,"[[""patients""], [""patients""], [""dystonia""], [""dystonia""], [""patients""], [""cramp""], [""DYT1""], [""patients""], [""generalized dystonia""], [""DYT1""], [""TOR1A""], [""primary dystonia""], [""familial dystonia""]]"

We sought to compare GPi DBS outcomes among the most common monogenic dystonias. METHODS:This systematic review and meta-analysis followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses and Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. We searched PubMed for studies on genetically confirmed monogenic dystonia treated with GPi DBS documenting pre-surgical and post-surgical assessments using the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale Motor Score (BFMMS) and Burke-Fahn-Marsden Disability Score (BFMDS). We performed (i) meta-analysis for each gene mutation; (ii) weighted ordinary linear regression analyses to compare BFMMS and BFMDS outcomes between DYT-TOR1A and other monogenic dystonias, adjusting for age and disease duration and (iii) weighted linear regression analysis to estimate the effect of age, sex and disease duration on GPi DBS outcomes. Results were summarised with mean change and 95% CI. RESULTS:DYT-TOR1A (68%, 38.4 points; p<0.001), DYT-THAP1 (37% 14.5 points; p<0.001) and NBIA/DYT-PANK2 (27%, 21.4 points; p<0.001) improved in BFMMS; only DYT-TOR1A improved in BFMDS (69%, 9.7 points; p<0.001). Improvement in DYT-TOR1A was significantly greater than in DYT-THAP1 (BFMMS -31%), NBIA/DYT-PANK2 (BFMMS -35%; BFMDS -53%) and CHOR/DYT-ADCY5 (BFMMS -36%; BFMDS -42%). Worse motor outcomes were associated with longer dystonia duration and older age at dystonia onset in DYT-TOR1A, longer dystonia duration in DYT/PARK-TAF1 and younger age at dystonia onset in DYT-SGCE.

"""17129379""","""Early onset torsion dystonia (Oppenheim's dystonia).""","""Early onset torsion dystonia (EOTD) is a rare movement disorder characterized by involuntary, repetitive, sustained muscle contractions or postures involving one or more sites of the body. A US study estimated the prevalence at approximately 1 in 30,000. The estimated prevalence in the general population of Europe seems to be lower, ranging from 1 in 330,000 to 1 in 200,000, although precise numbers are currently not available. The estimated prevalence in the Ashkenazi Jewish population is approximately five to ten times higher, due to a founder mutation. Symptoms of EOTD typically develop first in an arm or leg in middle to late childhood and progress in approximately 30% of patients to other body regions (generalized dystonia) within about five years. Distribution and severity of symptoms vary widely between affected individuals. The majority of cases from various ethnic groups are caused by an autosomal dominantly inherited deletion of 3 bp (GAG) in the DYT1 gene on chromosome 9q34. This gene encodes a protein named torsinA, which is presumed to act as a chaperone protein associated with the endoplasmic reticulum and the nuclear envelope. It may interact with the dopamine transporter and participate in intracellular trafficking, although its precise function within the cell remains to be determined. Molecular genetic diagnostic and genetic counseling is recommended for individuals with age of onset below 26 years, and may also be considered in those with onset after 26 years having a relative with typical early onset dystonia. Treatment options include botulinum toxin injections for focal symptoms, pharmacological therapy such as anticholinergics (most commonly trihexiphenydil) for generalized dystonia and surgical approaches such as deep brain stimulation of the internal globus pallidus or intrathecal baclofen application in severe cases. All patients have normal cognitive function, and despite a high rate of generalization of dystonia, 75% of those patients are able to maintain ambulation and independence, and therefore a comparatively good quality of life, with modern treatment modalities.""",13,"[[""patients""], [""dystonia""], [""baclofen""], [""movement disorder""], [""dystonia""], [""dopamine transporter""], [""botulinum""], [""DYT1""], [""patients""], [""torsinA""], [""trihexiphenydil""], [""torsion dystonia""], [""torsion dystonia""]]"

On the other hand, DYT1 mutation carriers without symptoms during these periods mostly do not exhibit symptoms later in their life. Little is known about what controls the timing of the onset, a critical issue for DYT1 mutation carriers. DYT11 myoclonus-dystonia is caused by mutations in SGCE coding for ε-sarcoglycan. Two dystonia patients from a single family with double mutations in DYT1 and SGCE exhibited more severe symptoms. A recent study suggested that torsinA contributes to the quality control of ε-sarcoglycan. Here, we derived mice carrying mutations in both Dyt1 and Sgce and found that these double mutant mice showed earlier onset of motor deficits in beam-walking test. A novel monoclonal antibody against mouse ε-sarcoglycan was developed by using Sgce knock-out mice to avoid the immune tolerance.

DYT11 M-D is caused by mutations in SGCE which codes for ɛ-sarcoglycan. SGCE is maternally imprinted and paternally expressed. Abnormal nuclear envelope has been reported in mouse models of DYT1 generalized torsion dystonia. However, it is not known whether similar alterations occur in DYT11 M-D. We developed a mouse model of DYT11 M-D using paternally inherited Sgce heterozygous knockout (Sgce KO) mice and reported that they had myoclonus and motor coordination and learning deficits in the beam-walking test. However, the specific brain regions that contribute to these phenotypes have not been identified. Since ɛ-sarcoglycan is highly expressed in the cerebellar Purkinje cells, here we examined the nuclear envelope in these cells using a transmission electron microscope and found that they are abnormal in Sgce KO mice. Our results put DYT11 M-D in a growing family of nuclear envelopathies. To analyze the effect of loss of ɛ-sarcoglycan function in the cerebellar Purkinje cells, we produced paternally inherited cerebellar Purkinje cell-specific Sgce conditional knockout (Sgce pKO) mice. Sgce pKO mice showed motor learning deficits, while they did not show abnormal nuclear envelope in the cerebellar Purkinje cells, robust motor deficits, or myoclonus. The results suggest that ɛ-sarcoglycan in the cerebellar Purkinje cells contributes to the motor learning, while loss of ɛ-sarcoglycan in other brain regions may contribute to nuclear envelope abnormality, myoclonus and motor coordination deficits.""",13,"[[""mice"", ""mouse"", ""murine"", ""transgenic mice"", ""nude mice"", ""transgenic"", ""mice (PV"", ""Mus musculus"", ""house mouse"", ""M. musculus"", ""129/sv"", ""mmu"", ""T/+ mice"", ""mice,"", ""129Sv"", ""N/+ mice"", ""mouse variant"", ""mice."", ""mouse:"", ""129 Sv"", ""TgM"", ""House Mouse subspecies"", ""Tg mice"", ""mouse strain"", ""TG"", ""mice.

TorsinA is an essential AAA(+) (ATPases associated with a variety of cellular activities) ATPase found in the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear envelope of higher eukaryotes, but what it does and how changes caused by the DeltaGAG deletion lead to dystonia are not known. Here, we asked how the DYT1 mutation affects association of torsinA with interacting proteins. Using immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, we first established that the related transmembrane proteins LULL1 and LAP1 are prominent binding partners for torsinA in U2OS cells. Comparative analysis demonstrates that these two proteins are targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum or nuclear envelope by their divergent N-terminal domains. Binding of torsinA to their C-terminal lumenal domains is stabilized when residues in any one of three motifs implicated in ATP hydrolysis (Walker B, sensor 1, and sensor 2) are mutated. Importantly, the DeltaGAG deletion does not stabilize this binding. Indeed, deleting the DeltaGAG encoded glutamic acid residue from any of the three ATP hydrolysis mutants destabilizes their association with LULL1 and LAP1C, suggesting a possible basis for loss of torsinA function. Impaired interaction of torsinA with LULL1 and/or LAP1 may thus contribute to the development of dystonia.""",13,"[[""glutamic acid""], [""dystonia""], [""ATP""], [""LAP1""], [""dystonia""], [""DYT1""], [""torsinA""], [""U2OS""], [""torsion dystonia""], [""torsinA""], [""TorsinA""], [""inherited movement disorder""], [""LULL1""]]"

While LAP1 lacks canonical nucleotide binding motifs, its strictly conserved arginine 563 is positioned exactly where the arginine finger of canonical AAA+ ATPases is found.

This abnormal pattern was characterized by increased metabolic activity in the lentiform nuclei, cerebellum, and supplementary motor areas. The MF pattern was present in DYT1 carriers with and without clinical manifestations and persisted in DYT1 dystonia patients in whom involuntary movements were suppressed by sleep. The second pattern, identified in an analysis of affected gene carriers with sustained contractions at rest, was designated movement related (MR). This pattern was characterized by increased metabolic activity in the midbrain, cerebellum, and thalamus. The expression of the MR pattern was increased in waking DYT1 patients with sustained dystonia, compared with DYT1 carriers who were unaffected or who had dystonia only on action, as well as normal controls. MR subject scores declined significantly with sleep in affected DYT1 patients but not in normal controls.

Although the mechanisms underlying the dystonic movements are largely unknown, abnormalities in striatal dopamine and acetylcholine neurotransmission are consistently implicated whereby dopamine release is reduced while cholinergic tone is increased. Because striatal cholinergic neurotransmission mediates dopamine release, it is not known if the dopamine release deficit is mediated indirectly by abnormal acetylcholine neurotransmission or if Tor1a(ΔE) acts directly within dopaminergic neurons to attenuate release. To dissect the microcircuit that governs the deficit in dopamine release, we conditionally expressed Tor1a(ΔE) in either dopamine neurons or cholinergic interneurons in mice and assessed striatal dopamine release using ex vivo fast scan cyclic voltammetry or dopamine efflux using in vivo microdialysis. Conditional expression of Tor1a(ΔE) in cholinergic neurons did not affect striatal dopamine release. In contrast, conditional expression of Tor1a(ΔE) in dopamine neurons reduced dopamine release to 50% of normal, which is comparable to the deficit in Tor1a<sup>+/ΔE</sup> knockin mice that express the mutation ubiquitously. Despite the deficit in dopamine release, we found that the Tor1a(ΔE) mutation does not cause obvious nerve terminal dysfunction as other presynaptic mechanisms, including electrical excitability, vesicle recycling/refilling, Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, D2 dopamine autoreceptor function and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor function, are intact.

Linkage analysis was performed using simple sequence repeat polymorphisms (CA repeats) closely associated with or spanning the chromosomal regions containing 15 candidate genes: the gene for early-onset generalized torsion dystonia, DYT1 (chromosome 9q34); the genes for subunits alpha 2, beta 1, and gamma 1 (chromosome 4p12-4q13); for alpha 1, alpha 6, beta 2, and gamma 2 (chromosome 5q31.1-5q31.3); for alpha 4, alpha 5, beta 3, and gamma 3 (chromosome 15q11-15q13); for rho 1 and rho 2 (chromosome 6q14-6q21) of the gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptor; and for the alpha subunit of the glycine receptor (chromosome 5q31). By a combination of pairwise and multipoint linkage analysis, it could be excluded that any of these candidate gene-bearing chromosomal regions contain the disease gene in this family. We also excluded major portions of three chromosomal regions syntenic with mouse chromosome 3, which carries the murine beta subunit of the glycine receptor.""",12,"[[""mice"", ""mouse"", ""murine"", ""transgenic mice"", ""nude mice"", ""transgenic"", ""mice (PV"", ""Mus musculus"", ""house mouse"", ""M. musculus"", ""129/sv"", ""mmu"", ""T/+ mice"", ""mice,"", ""129Sv"", ""N/+ mice"", ""mouse variant"", ""mice."", ""mouse:"", ""129 Sv"", ""TgM"", ""House Mouse subspecies"", ""Tg mice"", ""mouse strain"", ""TG"", ""mice.

Functional neuroimaging studies have provided some insight into the pathophysiology of disorders implicating particularly the prefrontal cortex, but there are no studies on psychogenic dystonia, and comparisons with findings in organic counterparts are rare. To understand the pathophysiology of these disorders better, we compared the similarities and differences in functional neuroimaging of patients with psychogenic dystonia and genetically determined dystonia, and tested hypotheses on the role of the prefrontal cortex in functional neurological disorders. Patients with psychogenic (n = 6) or organic (n = 5, DYT1 gene mutation positive) dystonia of the right leg, and matched healthy control subjects (n = 6) underwent positron emission tomography of regional cerebral blood flow. Participants were studied during rest, during fixed posturing of the right leg and during paced ankle movements. Continuous surface electromyography and footplate manometry monitored task performance. Averaging regional cerebral blood flow across all tasks, the organic dystonia group showed abnormal increases in the primary motor cortex and thalamus compared with controls, with decreases in the cerebellum. In contrast, the psychogenic dystonia group showed the opposite pattern, with abnormally increased blood flow in the cerebellum and basal ganglia, with decreases in the primary motor cortex. Comparing organic dystonia with psychogenic dystonia revealed significantly greater regional blood flow in the primary motor cortex, whereas psychogenic dystonia was associated with significantly greater blood flow in the cerebellum and basal ganglia (all P < 0.05, family-wise whole-brain corrected). Group × task interactions were also examined. During movement, compared with rest, there was abnormal activation in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex that was common to both organic and psychogenic dystonia groups (compared with control subjects, P < 0.05, family-wise small-volume correction). These data show a cortical-subcortical differentiation between organic and psychogenic dystonia in terms of regional blood flow, both at rest and during active motor tasks. The pathological prefrontal cortical activation was confirmed in, but was not specific to, psychogenic dystonia. This suggests that psychogenic and organic dystonia have different cortical and subcortical pathophysiology, while a derangement in mechanisms of motor attention may be a feature of both conditions.""",12,"[[""patients""], [""Patients""], [""Participants""], [""dystonia""], [""neurological disorders""], [""psychogenic dystonia""], [""psychogenic dystonia""], [""DYT1""], [""patients""], [""psychogenic movement disorders""], [""organic dystonia""], [""psychogenic versus organic dystonia""]]"

Recent meta-analyses, consensus statements, and evidence-based guidelines were incorporated. Emphasis was placed on deep brain stimulation (DBS) and randomized clinical trials; however, other stimulation modalities and trial designs were included. For each intervention the mean change in dystonia severity, number of patients studied, and evidence of efficacy based on American Academy of Neurology criteria were determined.<h4>Findings</h4>Strong (level B) evidence supports the use of DBS for the treatment of primary generalized or segmental dystonia, especially when due to mutation in the DYT1 gene, as well as for patients with cervical dystonia. Large effect sizes have also been reported for DBS treatment of tardive dystonia, writer's cramp, cranial dystonia, myoclonus dystonia, and off-state dystonia associated with Parkinson disease. Lesser benefit is generally seen in dystonia secondary to structural brain damage. Other brain stimulation techniques, including epidural cortical stimulation and noninvasive brain stimulation, have been investigated, but generally report smaller effect sizes in fewer patients.<h4>Conclusions and relevance</h4>Patients with dystonia that is not adequately controlled with standard medical therapy should be referred for consideration of DBS, especially patients with generalized, segmental, or cervical dystonia.

The resulting distortion in torsinA structure may underlie this mutant's known tendency to produce ER-derived inclusions as well as its proposed loss of function. The D/H polymorphism at residue 216 falls in the N-terminal portion of the AAA+ domain near the sensor 1 motif. Surprisingly, cells expressing torsinA with the polymorphic histidine developed inclusions similar to those associated with DeltaGAG-torsinA, indicating that this change may also affect torsinA structure. Introducing H216 into DeltaGAG-torsinA reduced its tendency to form inclusions, suggesting that the two changes offset each other. Our findings point to a structural basis for the defects associated with the disease-linked DeltaGAG deletion in torsinA. They also suggest possible connections between the allelic polymorphism at residue 216 and the penetrance of DYT1 dystonia, as well as a possible role for this polymorphism in related disease states.""",12,"[[""dystonia""], [""ATP""], [""dystonia""], [""histidine""], [""ClpB""], [""DYT1""], [""torsinA""], [""torsion dystonia""], [""torsinA""], [""aspartic acid (D) at residue 216""], [""H polymorphism at residue 216""], [""H216""]]"

Environmental factors may contribute to development of the phenotype since mutations in TOR1A are clinically penetrant in less than 40% of cases. Median age of onset is 10 and appearance of dystonia after 28 is rare. As a step towards understanding the temporal window of DYT1 disease penetrance, we have examined torsinA transcript and protein expression in rats from the embryonic period through adulthood. With relative quantitative multiplex real-time RT-PCR, we detected torsinA transcript in both neural (cerebellar cortex, striatum, cerebral cortex, thalamus and hippocampus) and non-neural (liver, kidney and heart) tissues at each developmental time point tested (embryonic day 20 [E20], postnatal day 1 [P1], P7, P14, P36, 6 months, 1.5 years). Levels of torsinA transcript were highest at E20 or P1 in all tissues examined except for the cerebellum where transcript levels peaked at P14. Early postnatal levels of torsinA transcript were over three times higher than those seen in adult rats. With quantitative radioactive in situ hybridization, torsinA transcript was widely distributed in brain at all ages with levels peaking at P14 in both cerebellum and striatum. TorsinA-immunoreactivity (IR) was present in neurons throughout the brain. TorsinA-IR was detected in perikarya, dendrites and axons but not nuclei. At P14, prominent expression of torsinA was noted in both striatal cholinergic interneurons and cerebellar Purkinje cells. Our results suggest that torsinA may contribute to postnatal maturational events in the brain such as dendritic arborization and synaptogenesis. Furthermore, the time course of torsinA expression in discrete components of motor networks is compatible with the temporal window of clinical penetrance in DYT1 mutation carriers.""",12,"[[""dystonia""], [""rat""], [""rats""], [""GAG""], [""torsinA""], [""generalized dystonia""], [""DYT1""], [""torsinA""], [""TOR1A""], [""TorsinA""], [""TorsinA-immunoreactivity""], [""IR""]]"

Nuclear envelope (NE) blebs that contain FG-nucleoporins (FG-Nups) and K48-linked ubiquitin are the hallmark phenotype of Torsin manipulation across disease models of DYT1 dystonia. While the aberrant deposition of FG-Nups is caused by defective nuclear pore complex assembly, the source of K48-ubiquitylated proteins inside NE blebs is not known. Here, we demonstrate that the characteristic K48-ubiquitin accumulation inside blebs requires p97 activity. This activity is highly dependent on the p97 adaptor UBXD1. We show that p97 does not significantly depend on the Ufd1/Npl4 heterodimer to generate the K48-ubiquitylated proteins inside blebs, nor does inhibiting translation affect the ubiquitin sequestration in blebs. However, stimulating global ubiquitylation by heat shock greatly increases the amount of K48-ubiquitin sequestered inside blebs. These results suggest that blebs have an extraordinarily high capacity for sequestering ubiquitylated protein generated in a p97-dependent manner.

Individual patient data, including age at onset of dystonia, age at surgery, gender, distribution of dystonia, etiology of dystonia, presence of associated features, abnormality of preoperative imaging, prior stereotactic surgeries, nucleus stimulated, type of anesthesia used, use of physiologic monitoring, type of imaging used for localization, stimulation parameters used, time of response to stimulation, and timing of outcome assessment were entered into an SPSS database for statistical analysis.

Our aim was to investigate whether the DYT1 mutation impairs the inner simulation of movements, a fundamental function for motor planning and execution, which relies upon cortical and subcortical systems, dysfunctional in dystonia.<h4>Methods</h4>DYT1 manifesting patients, DYT1 non-manifesting carriers and control subjects were asked to fixate body (hand, foot, face) or non-body (car) stimuli on a computer screen. Stimuli were presented at different degrees of orientations and subjects had to mentally rotate them, in order to give a laterality judgement. Reaction times and accuracy were collected.<h4>Results</h4>DYT1 carriers, manifesting and non-manifesting dystonic symptoms, were slower in mentally rotating body parts (but not cars) than control subjects.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The DYT1 gene mutation is associated with a slowness in mental simulation of movements, independently from the presence of motor symptoms.<h4>Significance</h4>These findings suggest that the cognitive representation of body movements may be altered subclinically in dystonia, thus contributing to the endophenotypic trait of disease.""",11,"[[""patients""], [""dystonia""], [""slowness""], [""dystonic symptoms""], [""GAG""], [""dystonic symptoms""], [""DYT1""], [""patients""], [""DYT1""], [""primary torsion dystonia""], [""dysfunctional in dystonia""]]"

While it usually manifests as early-onset dystonia, its phenotype is extremely diverse, even within one family. Recent reports have revealed that some DYT-TOR1A cases have novel mutations in the TOR1A gene while others have mutations in both TOR1A and another DYT gene (THAP1 or SGCE). Our understanding of the correlation between genotype and phenotype is becoming increasingly complicated.<h4>Case presentations</h4>Here, we report on monozygotic twins who developed dystonia in childhood. The two children had different presentations in terms of onset age and dominant disturbances, but both exhibited marked diurnal fluctuation and jerking movements of the limbs as well as levodopa/levodopa-carbidopa responsiveness. These features are commonly associated with DYT/PARK-GCH1 and DYT-SGCE, yet these twins had no mutations in the GCH1 or SGCE genes. Whole exome sequencing eventually revealed a single GAG deletion in the TOR1A gene.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Monozygotic twins whose only mutation was a GAG deletion in TOR1A exhibited DYT/PARK-GCH1-asssociated features and jerking movements reminiscent of myoclonus. This finding may expand the spectrum of phenotypes associated with DYT-TOR1A, and suggests that levodopa has potential as a treatment for DYT-TOR1A with DYT/PARK-GCH1-associated features.""",11,"[[""human"", ""patients"", ""patient"", ""infant"", ""mammalian"", ""infants"", ""boy"", ""child"", ""woman"", ""humans"", ""children"", ""girl"", ""Mammal"", ""boys"", ""participants"", ""women"", ""man"", ""donor"", ""persons"", ""Men"", ""person"", ""people"", ""girls"", ""peoples"", ""participant"", ""outpatient"", ""donor variant"", ""patient variant"", ""mammalians"", ""Homo sapiens"", ""Pt"", ""Homo sapiens Linnaeus, 1758"", ""pts"", ""H. sapiens"", ""humans.

In this study, the mechanisms by which high motor variability may influence movement generation in dystonia were investigated. Reaching movements in the symptomatic arm of 10 patients with DYT1 dystonia and 12 age-matched controls were captured using a robotic manipulandum and features of motor variability were extracted. Given that task-relevant variability and sensorimotor adaptation are related in health, markers of variability were then examined for any co-variance with performance indicators during an error-based learning visuomotor adaptation task. First, we confirmed that motor variability on a trial-by-trial basis was selectively increased in the homogenous and prototypical dystonic disorder DYT1 dystonia.

"""28843013""","""It's not just the basal ganglia: Cerebellum as a target for dystonia therapeutics.""","""Dystonia is a common movement disorder that devastates the lives of many patients, but the etiology of this disorder remains poorly understood. Dystonia has traditionally been considered a disorder of the basal ganglia. However, growing evidence suggests that the cerebellum may be involved in certain types of dystonia, raising several questions. Can different types of dystonia be classified as either a basal ganglia disorder or a cerebellar disorder? Is dystonia a network disorder that involves the cerebellum and basal ganglia? If dystonia is a network disorder, how can we target treatments to alleviate symptoms in patients? A recent study by Chen et al, using the pharmacological mouse model of rapid-onset dystonia parkinsonism, has provided some insight into these important questions. They showed that the cerebellum can directly modulate basal ganglia activity through a short latency cerebello-thalamo-basal ganglia pathway. Further, this article and others have provided evidence that in some cases, aberrant cerebello-basal ganglia communication can be involved in dystonia. In this review we examine the evidence for the involvement of the cerebellum and cerebello-basal ganglia interactions in dystonia. We conclude that there is ample evidence to suggest that the cerebellum plays a role in some dystonias, including the early-onset primary torsion dystonia DYT1 and that further studies examining the role of this brain region and its interaction with the basal ganglia in dystonia are warranted. © 2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.""",11,"[[""mice"", ""mouse"", ""murine"", ""transgenic mice"", ""nude mice"", ""transgenic"", ""mice (PV"", ""Mus musculus"", ""house mouse"", ""M. musculus"", ""129/sv"", ""mmu"", ""T/+ mice"", ""mice,"", ""129Sv"", ""N/+ mice"", ""mouse variant"", ""mice."", ""mouse:"", ""129 Sv"", ""TgM"", ""House Mouse subspecies"", ""Tg mice"", ""mouse strain"", ""TG"", ""mice.

Despite being a first-line testing tool for heterogeneous inherited disorders, whole-exome sequencing has not yet been evaluated in dystonia diagnostics. We set up a pilot study to address the yield of whole-exome sequencing for early-onset generalized dystonia, a disease subtype enriched for monogenic causation.<h4>Methods</h4>Clinical whole-exome sequencing coupled with bioinformatics analysis and detailed phenotyping of mutation carriers was performed on 16 consecutive cases with genetically undefined early-onset generalized dystonia. Candidate pathogenic variants were validated and tested for cosegregation. The whole-exome approach was complemented by analyzing 2 mutated yet unestablished causative genes in another 590 dystonia cases.<h4>Results</h4>Whole-exome sequencing detected clinically relevant mutations of known dystonia-related genes in 6 generalized dystonia cases (37.5%), among whom 3 had novel variants. Reflecting locus heterogeneity, identified unique variants were distributed over 5 genes (GCH1, THAP1, TOR1A, ANO3, ADCY5), of which only 1 (ANO3) was mutated recurrently. Three genes (GCH1, THAP1, TOR1A) were associated with isolated generalized dystonia, whereas 2 (ANO3, ADCY5) gave rise to combined dystonia-myoclonus phenotypes. Follow-up screening of ANO3 and ADCY5 revealed a set of distinct variants of interest, the pathogenicity of which was supported by bioinformatics testing and cosegregation work.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our study identified whole-exome sequencing as an effective strategy for molecular diagnosis of early-onset generalized dystonia and offers insights into the heterogeneous genetic architecture of this condition.

"""12151848""","""Dystonia: clinical features, genetics, and treatment.""","""<h4>Purpose of review</h4>The present review covers recent advances in dystonia research related to dystonia genetics and treatment. These have led to the discovery of novel dystonia genes and loci, to changing classification schemes, and to the introduction of improved and new treatment options.<h4>Recent findings</h4>Currently 13 different forms of dystonia can be distinguished on a genetic basis (dystonia types 1-13). Recently, a novel gene locus (DYT13) was detected in a family with segmental dystonia, and the gene causing myoclonus-dystonia was identified (SGCE). Furthermore, a novel mutation in the DYT1 gene is associated with a myoclonus-dystonia phenotype. Regarding dystonia treatment, patients refractory to botulinum toxin type A can now be treated with botulinum toxin type B. Selective peripheral denervation remains an effective form of treatment for patients with secondary, but probably not with primary botulinum toxin treatment failure. Finally, a renaissance of functional surgical ablative procedures has taken place, with high frequency deep brain stimulation being introduced in dystonia treatment. Bilateral pallidotomy or pallidal stimulation may provide major benefit especially in patients with generalized, disabling dystonia with the most dramatic improvements in dystonia type 1 patients. Neurostimulation may also be effective in primary segmental axial dystonia, myoclonus-dystonia, and tardive dystonia.<h4>Summary</h4>The recent mapping of additional dystonia gene loci, the identification of novel dystonia genes, and the characterization of proteins encoded by these genes have enhanced our understanding of various forms and aspects of the dystonias and have opened up new avenues for research.

We investigated torsinA and torsinB message and protein levels in the developing mouse brain. TorsinA expression was highest during prenatal and early postnatal development (until postnatal day 14; P14), whereas torsinB expression was highest during late postnatal periods (from P14 onwards) and in the adult. In addition, significant regional variation in the expression of the two torsins was seen within the developing brain. Thus, torsinA expression was highest in the cerebral cortex from embryonic day 15 (E15)-E17 and in the striatum from E17-P7, while torsinB was highest in the cerebral cortex between P7-P14 and in the striatum from P7-P30. TorsinA was also highly expressed in the thalamus from P0-P7 and in the cerebellum from P7-P14. Although functional significance of the patterns of torsinA and B expression in the developing brain remains to be established, our findings provide a basis for investigating the role of torsins in specific processes such as neurogenesis, neuronal migration, axon/dendrite development, and synaptogenesis.""",11,"[[""mouse""], [""torsinA""], [""DYT1""], [""TOR1A""], [""torsinA""], [""TorsinA""], [""mouse""], [""torsion dystonia""], [""torsinB""], [""torsinA""], [""torsinB""]]"
"""23840813""","""Torsin A Localization in the Mouse Cerebellar Synaptic Circuitry.""","""Torsin A (TA) is a ubiquitous protein belonging to the superfamily of proteins called \""ATPases associated with a variety of cellular activities\"" (AAA(+) ATPase). To date, a great deal of attention has been focused on neuronal TA since its mutant form causes early-onset (DYT1) torsion dystonia, an inherited movement disorder characterized by sustained muscle contractions and abnormal postures. Interestingly, it has been proposed that TA, by interacting with the cytoskeletal network, may contribute to the control of neurite outgrowth and/or by acting as a chaperone at synapses could affect synaptic vesicle turnover and neurotransmitter release. Accordingly, both its peculiar developmental expression in striatum and cerebellum and evidence from DYT1 knock-in mice suggest that TA may influence dendritic arborization and synaptogenesis in the brain. Therefore, to better understand TA function a detailed description of its localization at synaptic level is required. Here, we characterized by means of rigorous quantitative confocal analysis TA distribution in the mouse cerebellum at postnatal day 14 (P14), when both cerebellar synaptogenesis and TA expression peak. We observed that the protein is broadly distributed both in cerebellar cortex and in the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN). Of note, Purkinje cells (PC) express high levels of TA also in the spines and axonal terminals. In addition, abundant expression of the protein was found in the main GABA-ergic and glutamatergic inputs of the cerebellar cortex. Finally, TA was observed also in glial cells, a cellular population little explored so far. These results extend our knowledge on TA synaptic localization providing a clue to its potential role in synaptic development.""",11,"[[""mouse""], [""mice""], [""Mouse""], [""movement disorder""], [""GABA""], [""DYT1""], [""mouse""], [""mice""], [""torsion dystonia""], [""Torsin A""], [""Torsin A""]]"

By contrast, genotype-specific increases in metabolism were found in the putamen, anterior cingulate (BA 24/32), and cerebellar hemispheres of DYT1 carriers. Genotype-specific changes in DYT6 involved hypometabolism of the putamen and hypermetabolism in the temporal cortex (BA 21).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Dystonia may be associated with abnormal movement preparation caused by defective sensorimotor integration.

The purpose of this study was to establish whether the sensory system is affected in other types of dystonias and whether the contralateral hand is also involved in FHD. We used a spatial acuity measure (Johnson-Van Boven-Phillips domes) to evaluate sensory spatial discrimination in both hands of patients with different forms of dystonias including primary generalized DYT1 dystonia (associated with a unique deletion in the DYT1 gene) (n = 13), FHD (n = 15), benign essential blepharospasm (n = 9), cervical dystonia (n = 10) and in age-matched controls. Clinical evaluation included the Fahn dystonia scale for the focal dystonia groups and the Marsden-Burke-Fahn scale for the generalized dystonia group. Spatial discrimination was normal in patients with DYT1 dystonia, despite all of these patients having hand dystonia. However, spatial discrimination thresholds were significantly increased in both hands in the focal dystonia groups (thresholds were similar for each group) and did not correlate significantly with either severity or duration of dystonic symptoms. Thresholds were significantly increased in the dominant hand compared with the non-dominant hand only within the FHD group. Our observations demonstrate involvement of both the dominant and non-dominant somatosensory cortices, and suggest that abnormal sensory processing is a fundamental disturbance in patients with focal dystonia. These findings of altered sensory processing in idiopathic focal but not generalized DYT1 dystonia suggest both a primary pathophysiological role for the phenomenon in focal dystonia and divergent pathophysiological processes in the two conditions.""",11,"[[""human"", ""patients"", ""patient"", ""infant"", ""mammalian"", ""infants"", ""boy"", ""child"", ""woman"", ""humans"", ""children"", ""girl"", ""Mammal"", ""boys"", ""participants"", ""women"", ""man"", ""donor"", ""persons"", ""Men"", ""person"", ""people"", ""girls"", ""peoples"", ""participant"", ""outpatient"", ""donor variant"", ""patient variant"", ""mammalians"", ""Homo sapiens"", ""Pt"", ""Homo sapiens Linnaeus, 1758"", ""pts"", ""H. sapiens"", ""humans.

We conducted a retrospective analysis of their demographics, clinical presentation and time to generalisation, genetic status and family history, and response to DBS treatment of the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi), utilising pre- and post-surgical scores of the United Dystonia Rating Scale (UDRS).<h4>Results</h4>Three patients, all of black African ancestry, were identified. The median age at onset was 12 years and the median time to surgery from dystonia generalisation was 3 years. Two children presented with cervical-onset dystonia. Two patients were related, representing the only two with a positive family history. All three patients had a positive outcome after surgery, with improvement of 67 - 90% on the UDRS recorded at last follow-up.<h4>Conclusions</h4>TOR1A mutations are found in SA patients of black African ancestry, with age of onset and generalisation comparable to those described in international studies.

Accordingly, the rate of responders was considerably lower in the latter group (57% vs >90%; p = 0.017). At late follow-up, however, GPi-DBS resulted in comparable improvement in all 3 groups (DYT6, -42%; DYT1, -44; non-DYT, -61%). Additional DBS of the same or another brain target was performed in 3 of 8 patients with DYT6 dystonia with varying results.

According to recent genetic studies, DYT6 (THAP1) gene mutations are an important cause of primary early-onset dystonia. In contrast to DYT1 mutations, THAP1 mutations are associated with primary early-onset segmental or generalised dystonia frequently involving the craniocervical region and the larynx. Blood samples from twelve individuals of three German families with DYT6 positive index cases were obtained to test for THAP1 mutations. Eight THAP1 MutC were identified. Of these, six (three symptomatic and three asymptomatic) THAP1 MutC could be clinically evaluated. Laryngoscopy was performed to evaluate laryngeal dysfunction in patients. Brainstem echogenicity was investigated in all MutC using TCS. Two of the patients had undergone bilateral pallidal DBS. In all three symptomatic MutC, early-onset laryngeal dystonia was a prominent feature. Laryngeal assessment demonstrated adductor-type dystonia in all of them. On clinical examination, the three asymptomatic MutC also showed subtle signs of focal or segmental dystonia. TCS revealed increased substantia nigra (SN) hyperechogenicity in all MutC. Intraoperative microelectrode recordings under general anesthesia in two of the patients showed no difference between THAP1 and previously operated DYT1 MutC. The presence of spasmodic dysphonia in patients with young-onset segmental or generalised dystonia is a hallmark of DYT6 dystonia. SN hyperechogenicity on TCS may represent an endophenotype in these patients.

We report an association of the homozygous dominant disease-causing TOR1A p.Glu303del mutation, and a novel homozygous missense variant (p.Gly318Ser) with a severe arthrogryposis phenotype with developmental delay, strabismus and tremor in three unrelated Iranian families. All parents who were carriers of the TOR1A variant showed no evidence of neurological symptoms or signs, indicating decreased penetrance similar to families with autosomal dominant torsion dystonia-1. The results from cell assays demonstrate that the p.Gly318Ser substitution causes a redistribution of torsinA from the endoplasmic reticulum to the nuclear envelope, similar to the hallmark of the p.Glu303del mutation.

The deletion in DYT1 associated with torsion dystonia results in the loss of one of a pair of glutamic acid residues residing near the C terminus of torsin A (DeltaE-torsin A). At present, little is known about the expression, subcellular distribution, and/or function of either the torsin A or DeltaE-torsin A protein. When transfected into mammalian cells, both torsin A and DeltaE-torsin A were found to behave as lumenally oriented glycoproteins. Immunofluorescence studies revealed that torsin A localized to a diffuse network of intracellular membranes displaying significant co-immunoreactivity for the endoplasmic reticulum resident protein BiP, whereas DeltaE-torsin A resided in large spheroid intracellular structures exclusive of BiP immunoreactivity. These results initially suggested that DeltaE-torsin A might exist as insoluble aggregates. However, both torsin A and DeltaE-torsin A were readily solubilized by nonionic detergents, were similarly accessible to proteases, and displayed equivalent migration patterns on sucrose gradients. Collectively, these data support that both the wild type and torsion dystonia-associated forms of torsin A are properly folded, lumenal proteins of similar oligomeric states.

"""27171035""","""Thalamic Volume Is Reduced in Cervical and Laryngeal Dystonias.""","""<h4>Background</h4>Dystonia, a debilitating movement disorder characterized by abnormal fixed positions and/or twisting postures, is associated with dysfunction of motor control networks. While gross brain lesions can produce secondary dystonias, advanced neuroimaging techniques have been required to identify network abnormalities in primary dystonias. Prior neuroimaging studies have provided valuable insights into the pathophysiology of dystonia, but few directly assessed the gross volume of motor control regions, and to our knowledge, none identified abnormalities common to multiple types of idiopathic focal dystonia.<h4>Methods</h4>We used two gross volumetric segmentation techniques and one voxelwise volumetric technique (voxel based morphometry, VBM) to compare regional volume between matched healthy controls and patients with idiopathic primary focal dystonia (cervical, n = 17, laryngeal, n = 7). We used (1) automated gross volume measures of eight motor control regions using the FreeSurfer analysis package; (2) blinded, anatomist-supervised manual segmentation of the whole thalamus (also gross volume); and (3) voxel based morphometry, which measures local T1-weighted signal intensity and estimates gray matter density or volume at the level of single voxels, for both whole-brain and thalamus.<h4>Results</h4>Using both automated and manual gross volumetry, we found a significant volume decrease only in the thalamus in two focal dystonias. Decreases in whole-thalamic volume were independent of head and brain size, laterality of symptoms, and duration. VBM measures did not differ between dystonia and control groups in any motor control region.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Reduced thalamic gross volume, detected in two independent analyses, suggests a common anatomical abnormality in cervical dystonia and spasmodic dysphonia.

The results are briefly compared with those reported for DBS in DYT1 dystonia (Oppenheim dystonia), which is caused by the DYT1 gene. METHODS: Enrollment in this prospective expanded pilot study was limited to adult patients with severely disabling, medically refractory non-DYT1 generalized dystonia or choreoathetosis. Six consecutive patients underwent follow-up examinations at defined intervals of 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years postsurgery. There were five women and one man, and their mean age at surgery was 45.5 years. Formal assessments included both the Burke-Fahn-Marsden dystonia scale and the recently developed Unified Dystonia Rating Scale. Two patients had primary generalized non-DYT1 dystonia, and four suffered from choreoathetosis secondary to infantile cerebral palsy. Bilateral quadripolar DBS electrodes were implanted in all instances, except in one patient with markedly asymmetrical symptoms. There were no adverse events related to surgery. The Burke-Fahn-Marsden scores in the two patients with generalized dystonia improved by 78 and 71% at 3 months, by 82 and 69% at 1 year, and by 78 and 70% at 2 years postoperatively. This was paralleled by marked amelioration of disability scores. The mean improvement in Burke-Fahn-Marsden scores in patients with choreoathetosis was 12% at 3 months, 29% at 1 year, and 23% at 2 years postoperatively, which was not significant. Two of these patients thought that they had achieved marked improvement at 2 years postoperatively, although results of objective evaluations were less impressive. In these two patients there was a minor but stable improvement in disability scores. All patients had an improvement in pain scores at the 2-year follow-up review. Medication was tapered off in both patients with generalized dystonia and reduced in two of the patients with choreoathetosis. All stimulation-induced side effects were reversible on adjustment of the DBS settings. Energy consumption of the batteries was considerably higher than in patients with Parkinson disease. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic pallidal DBS is a safe and effective procedure in generalized non-DYT1 dystonia, and it may become the procedure of choice in patients with medically refractory dystonia. Postoperative improvement of choreoathetosis is more modest and varied, and subjective ratings of outcome may exceed objective evaluations.""",9,"[[""human"", ""patients"", ""patient"", ""infant"", ""mammalian"", ""infants"", ""boy"", ""child"", ""woman"", ""humans"", ""children"", ""girl"", ""Mammal"", ""boys"", ""participants"", ""women"", ""man"", ""donor"", ""persons"", ""Men"", ""person"", ""people"", ""girls"", ""peoples"", ""participant"", ""outpatient"", ""donor variant"", ""patient variant"", ""mammalians"", ""Homo sapiens"", ""Pt"", ""Homo sapiens Linnaeus, 1758"", ""pts"", ""H. sapiens"", ""humans.

In the current study, we expanded this research field by investigating the critical role of ER stress underlying synaptic plasticity impairment imposed by mutant heterozygous Tor1a<sup>+/-</sup> in a DYT1 dystonia mouse model.<h4>Methods</h4>Heterozygous Tor1a<sup>+/-</sup> mouse model for DYT1 dystonia was established. Wild-type (Tor1a<sup>+/+</sup>, N=10) and mutant (Tor1a<sup>+/-</sup>, N=10) mice from post-natal day P25 to P35 were randomly distributed to experimental and control groups. Patch-clamp and current-clamp recordings of SPNs were conducted with intracellular electrodes for electrophysiological analyses. Striatal changes of the direct and indirect pathways were investigated via immunofluorescence. Golgi-Cox staining was conducted to observe spine morphology of SPNs. To quantify postsynaptic signaling proteins in striatum, RNA-Seq, qRT-PCR and WB were performed in striatal tissues.<h4>Results</h4>Long-term depression (LTD) was failed to be induced, while long-term potentiation (LTP) was further strengthened in striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs) from the Tor1a<sup>+/-</sup> DYT1 dystonia mice. Spine morphology analyses revealed a significant increase of both number of mushroom type spines and spine width in Tor1a<sup>+/-</sup> SPNs. In addition, increased AMPA receptor function and the reduction of NMDA/AMPA ratio in the postsynaptic of Tor1a<sup>+/-</sup> SPNs was observed, along with increased ER stress protein levels in striatum of Tor1a<sup>+/-</sup> DYT1 dystonia mice. Notably, ER stress inhibitors, tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), could rescue LTD as well as AMPA currents.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The current study illustrated the role of ER stress in mediating structural and functional plasticity alterations in Tor1a<sup>+/-</sup> SPNs. Inhibition of the ER stress by TUDCA is beneficial in reversing the deficits at the cellular and molecular levels.

Genetic, metabolic, and imaging studies ruled out known causes of dystonia. Cognition was subnormal but stable until the last few years. Death occurred at ages 21 and 22 years. The brains were macroscopically unremarkable. Microscopic examination showed unusual glial fibrillary acidic protein-immunoreactive astrocytes in multiple regions and iron accumulation in pallidal and nigral neurons. However, the most striking findings were 1) eosinophilic, rod-like cytoplasmic inclusions in neocortical and thalamic neurons that were actin depolymerizing factor/cofilin-immunoreactive but only rarely actin-positive; and 2) abundant eosinophilic spherical structures in the striatum that were strongly actin- and actin depolymerizing factor/cofilin-positive. Electron microscopy suggested that these structures represent degenerating neurons and processes; the accumulating filaments had the same dimensions as actin microfilaments.

This study investigated the frequency and clinical features of DYT1 in a Taiwanese dystonia cohort.<h4>Methods</h4>We performed targeted next generation sequencing in 318 patients with primary dystonia. We identified one DYT1 family with various types of dystonia, and we described the clinical presentations observed in this family during a 30-year follow-up. We compared the clinical characteristics to those reported in previous studies on DYT1 from 2000 to 2020.<h4>Results</h4>Among 318 patients, we identified only one DYT1 patient (0.3%) with an autosomal dominant family history of dystonia. The proband was a 43-year-old man that experienced progressive onset of focal lower limb dystonia from age 11 years. The disease spread caudal-rostrally to the upper limbs and cervical muscles. Prominent cervical dystonia was noted during follow-up, which was an atypical presentation of DYT1. Clinical assessments of other family members showed intrafamily variability. The proband's father and an affected sibling demonstrated only mild right-hand writer's cramp. A systematic review of previously reported DTY1 cases showed that Asian patients had a higher frequency of cervical dystonia (44.8%) than groups of Ashkenazi Jews (35%) and Non-Jewish Caucasians (30.5%) (P = 0.04).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our findings revealed that DYT1 is rare in a Taiwanese dystonia cohort.

Globus pallidus interna deep brain stimulation (GPi-DBS) has been shown to provide significant improvement in these cases.<h4>Methods</h4>This was a retrospective study of TOR1A mutation positive dystonia patients, conducted at a university hospital from 2006 to 2018. Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale (BFM-DRS) was used to evaluate dystonia severity before and after surgery. Emergence of postsurgical parkinsonian symptoms was evaluated using the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) part III. Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) was applied to assess cognitive dysfunction. SPSS version 18 was used for data analysis.<h4>Results</h4>Eleven patients entered for analysis with an average age of 22.36 (±3.35) years (range: 18-28). Seven patients (63.6 %) were female.

Short-lived ubiquitylated proteins that are normally rapidly degraded partition into the bleb lumen and become stabilized. In addition, blebs selectively sequester a specific HSP40-HSP70 chaperone network that is modulated by the bleb component MLF2.

DYT1 cases had features similar to sporadic non-DYT1 cases but differed markedly from familial non-DYT1 cases, the latter having later age at onset, less common limb onset, more frequent cervical involvement, and slower progression than DYT1 PTD. These findings indicate that non-DYT1 forms of EO-PTD differ clinically from those of DYT1 forms. Cranial involvement before 21 years of age is the strongest predictor of non-DYT1 status.

Most familial forms of ITD follow autosomal dominant transmission with reduced penetrance.

Recently, a gene for ITD (DYT1) in a non-Jewish kindred was located on chromosome 9q32-34, with tight linkage to the gene encoding gelsolin (GSN). In the present study linkage analysis using DNA polymorphisms is used to locate a gene responsible for susceptibility to ITD in 12 Ashkenazi Jewish families. This dystonia gene exhibits close linkage with the gene encoding argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS), and appears by multipoint analysis to lie in the q32-34 region of chromosome 9, a region that also contains the loci for gelsolin and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase. The same gene may be responsible for ITD both in the non-Jewish kindred mentioned above and in the Ashkenazi Jewish families presented here.

To assess more broadly the role of this gene, we screened for mutations in families that included one family member who had early-onset, non-focal primary dystonia.<h4>Methods</h4>We identified 36 non-DYT1 multiplex families in which at least one person had non-focal involvement at an age of onset that was younger than 22 years. All three coding exons of THAP1 were sequenced, and the clinical features of individuals with mutations were compared with those of individuals who were negative for mutations in THAP1. Genotype-phenotype differences were also assessed.<h4>Findings</h4>Of 36 families, nine (25%) had members with mutations in THAP1, and most were of German, Irish, or Italian ancestry. One family had the Amish-Mennonite founder mutation, whereas the other eight families each had novel, potentially truncating or missense mutations.

In families with action-type dystonia, there are cases with focal and segmental dystonia. Ages of onset of postural-type dystonia are around 6 years, and 8 to 10 years in cases of action-type dystonia. Focal and segmental dystonia develops in the teens. Mental and psychological functions are preserved. DYT5 is caused by heterozygous mutations of the GCH1 gene, located on 14q22.1-q22.2. Again, mental and psychological functions are preserved. Clinically, there are two types: postural and action. Postural-type dystonia occurs around 6 years of age, with postural dystonia of one leg, and all extremities and trunk muscles are involved by the late teens. Action-type dystonia shows dystonic movements from around 8 to 10 years of age. In both types, all symptoms show diurnal fluctuations that diminish with age and are no longer apparent in the late teens. L-dopa produces dramatic effects, which continue throughout the course of the illness. In both postural and action types, each family or sporadic case has a particular mutation.

To date, 19 different forms of monogenic dystonia (primary dystonias and dystonia-plus syndromes) have been identified and classified as DYT loci.

De novo and inherited missense and protein truncating variation in GNAL as well as primarily missense variation in ANO3 cause isolated focal and/or segmental dystonia with preference for the upper half of the body and older ages at onset. The GAG deletion in TOR1A is associated with generalized dystonia with onset in childhood in the lower limbs. Rare variation in these genes causes monogenic sporadic and inherited forms of isolated dystonia; common variation may confer risk and imply that dystonia is a polygenic trait in a subset of cases. Although candidate gene screens have been successful in the past in detecting gene-disease associations, recent application of whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing methods enable unbiased capture of all genetic variation that may explain the phenotype. However, careful variant-level evaluation is necessary in every case, even in genes that have previously been associated with disease.

Index cases were screened for mutations in the SGCE, DYT1, and DRD2 genes and for deletions of the SGCE gene. Suitable mutation negative families were tested for linkage to the SGCE region and to chromosome 18p11.<h4>Results</h4>Two SGCE mutations were detected among the seven familial but no mutation in the sporadic cases. Haplotype analysis at the new M-D locus was compatible with linkage in two families and excluded in another family, suggesting at least one additional M-D gene. There were no obvious clinical differences between M-D families with and without detected mutations.<h4>Conclusion</h4>M-D is genetically heterogeneous with SGCE mutations accounting for the disease in only part of the clinically typical cases.""",8,"[[""human"", ""patients"", ""patient"", ""infant"", ""mammalian"", ""infants"", ""boy"", ""child"", ""woman"", ""humans"", ""children"", ""girl"", ""Mammal"", ""boys"", ""participants"", ""women"", ""man"", ""donor"", ""persons"", ""Men"", ""person"", ""people"", ""girls"", ""peoples"", ""participant"", ""outpatient"", ""donor variant"", ""patient variant"", ""mammalians"", ""Homo sapiens"", ""Pt"", ""Homo sapiens Linnaeus, 1758"", ""pts"", ""H. sapiens"", ""humans.

The genes TOR1A, THAP1 and GNAL were screened using a combination of high-resolution melting analysis and direct DNA resequencing. In addition, an extensive literature search to identify original articles (published before 10 August 2020) reporting mutations in TOR1A, THAP1 or GNAL associated to dystonia was performed.<h4>Results</h4>Pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in TOR1A, THAP1 and GNAL were identified in 0.48%, 0.57% and 0.29% of our patients, respectively. Five patients carried the variation p.Glu303del in TOR1A. A very rare variant in GNAL (p.Ser238Asn) was found as a putative risk factor for dystonia. In the literature, variations in TOR1A, THAP1 and GNAL accounted for about 6%, 1.8% and 1.1% of published dystonia patients, respectively.<h4>Conclusions</h4>There is a different genetic contribution to dystonia of these three genes in our patients (about 1.3% of patients) and in the literature (about 3.6% of patients), probably due the high proportion of adult-onset cases in our cohort. As regards age at onset, site of dystonia onset, and final distribution, in our population there is a clear differentiation between DYT-TOR1A and DYT-GNAL, with DYT-THAP1 likely to be an intermediate phenotype.""",8,"[[""human"", ""patients"", ""patient"", ""infant"", ""mammalian"", ""infants"", ""boy"", ""child"", ""woman"", ""humans"", ""children"", ""girl"", ""Mammal"", ""boys"", ""participants"", ""women"", ""man"", ""donor"", ""persons"", ""Men"", ""person"", ""people"", ""girls"", ""peoples"", ""participant"", ""outpatient"", ""donor variant"", ""patient variant"", ""mammalians"", ""Homo sapiens"", ""Pt"", ""Homo sapiens Linnaeus, 1758"", ""pts"", ""H. sapiens"", ""humans.

Previous haplotype analysis in a 2 cM region surrounding the DYT1 gene showed that a single founder mutation (DYT1AJ) was responsible for most cases of early onset PTD in the North American AJ population and refined the most likely location of the gene to a 150 kb interval between the marker loci D9S2161 and D9S63. Recently, the majority of cases of early onset PTD in both AJ and non-Jewish patients were found to carry a unique 3-bp (GAG) deletion in the coding region of the DYT1 gene. This deletion appears to have arisen more than once, suggesting independent mutational events. In this study, we analysed the haplotypes surrounding DYT1 in 9 AJ and 15 non-Jewish British patients carrying the GAG deletion in the DYT1 gene. We found that all AJ British patients carried the same haplotype as the North American Jews, sustaining the theory that the current British AJ community descends from the same small group of individuals as the North American Jewry. Furthermore, in the non-Jewish British patients, only a limited number of distinct founder mutations was observed.

We further examined the compartmental proteomes following exposure to thapsigargin (Tg), an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stressor, because DYT-TOR1A dystonia models have previously shown abnormalities in cellular stress responses. Across both subcellular compartments, proteomes of DYT-TOR1A cells showed basal state disruptions consistent with an activated stress response, and in response to thapsigargin, a blunted stress response. However, the DYT-TOR1A nuclear proteome under Tg cell stress showed the most pronounced and disproportionate degree of protein disruptions - 3-fold greater than all other conditions. The affected proteins extended beyond those typically associated with stress responses, including enrichments for processes critical for neuronal synaptic function.

To define the temporal requirements for torsinA in normal motor function and gene replacement therapy, we developed a mouse line enabling spatiotemporal control of the endogenous torsinA allele. Suppressing torsinA during embryogenesis caused dystonia-mimicking behavioral and neuropathological phenotypes. Suppressing torsinA during adulthood, however, elicited no discernible abnormalities, establishing an essential requirement for torsinA during a developmental critical period. The developing CNS exhibited a parallel \""therapeutic critical period\"" for torsinA repletion. Although restoring torsinA in juvenile DYT1 mice rescued motor phenotypes, there was no benefit from adult torsinA repletion. These data establish a unique requirement for torsinA in the developing nervous system and demonstrate that the critical period genetic insult provokes permanent pathophysiology mechanistically delinked from torsinA function.

Additionally, reports of linkage disequilibrium between several chromosome 18 markers and focal dystonia, both in sporadic patients from northern Germany and in members of affected families from central Europe suggest the existence of a founder mutation underlying focal dystonia in this population.

The subclassification of these patients included 344 with primary forms of dystonia, 10 with myoclonus dystonia, 19 with heredodegenerative dystonias and 93 who had DBS for secondary dystonia. Patients with primary forms of dystonia, myoclonus dystonia, subtypes of heredo-degenerative dystonia and tardive dystonia have a greater than 50% mean improvement in dystonia severity following DBS. Among patients with primary generalised dystonia, multiple regression analysis showed that a shorter duration of symptoms (p=0.008), a lower baseline severity score (p=0.024) and DYT1 positive status (p=0.002) were all independently associated with a significantly higher percentage improvement from surgery. Patients with other forms of heredodegenerative and secondary dystonia have variable responses, making prediction of response in future patients difficult. The degree of dystonia response that justifies DBS is a highly subjective issue.

The remaining three had onset in the neck, face, and larynx. Dystonia progressed to involve at least one arm and one leg in all seven and there was cranial involvement in six. Five of these six had moderate or severe speech impairment. Linkage analysis with 9q34 markers excluded the region containing the DYT1 locus in this family.

For genetic variants with sufficient information in at least two independent datasets, random-effects meta-analyses were performed, including meta-analyses stratified by ethnic descent and dystonia subtypes.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 3575 articles were identified and scrutinized resulting in the inclusion of 42 independent publications allowing 134 meta-analyses on 45 variants across 17 genes. While our meta-analyses pinpointed several association signals with variants in TOR1A, DRD1, and ARSG, no single variant displayed compelling association with dystonia in the available data.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our study provides an up-to-date summary of the status of dystonia genetic association studies.

We report the first clinical case of a severe early-onset generalized dystonia dramatically improved by a bilateral stimulation of the internal globus pallidus. In November 1996, we proposed this neurosurgical procedure for a 8-year-old girl, who had suffered since the age of 3 from severe generalized dystonia, and who progressively became totally dependent and bedridden. She had been under sedation and permanent controlled respiratory assistance for the last two months. The etiology of the disease remained unknown (the DYT1 mutation was absent). Under general anesthesia, we bilaterally implanted a four-contacts electrode in the internal globus pallidus, using the Leksell's stereotactic frame and a 1.5 tesla MRI control.

Measures of D(2) receptor availability in the caudate nucleus and putamen were determined using an automated region-of-interest approach. Values from mutation carriers and healthy controls were compared using analysis of variance to assess the effects of genotype and phenotype. Additionally, voxel-based whole brain searches were conducted to detect group differences in extrastriatal regions.<h4>Results</h4>Significant reductions in caudate and putamen D(2) receptor availability were evident in both groups of mutation carriers relative to healthy controls (p < 0.001). The changes were greater in DYT6 relative to DYT1 carriers (-38.0 +/- 3.0% vs -15.0 +/- 3.0%, p < 0.001). By contrast, there was no significant difference between manifesting and nonmanifesting carriers of either genotype. Voxel-based analysis confirmed these findings and additionally revealed reduced RAC binding in the ventrolateral thalamus of both groups of mutation carriers. As in the striatum, the thalamic binding reductions were more pronounced in DYT6 carriers and were not influenced by the presence of clinical manifestations.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Reduced D(2) receptor availability in carriers of dystonia genes is compatible with dysfunction or loss of D(2)-bearing neurons, increased synaptic dopamine levels, or both.

Substance P, a member of the tachykinin family of neuropeptides, is a major component in the direct pathway from striatum to basal ganglia output nuclei. In the present study quantitative autoradiography was used to examine changes in neurokinin-1 (NK-1) and neurokinin-3 (NK-3) receptors in mutant dystonic hamsters (dt(sz)), a well characterized model of paroxysmal dystonia. NK-1 receptors were labeled in 10 dystonic brains and 10 age-matched controls with 3 nM [(3)H]-[Sar(9), Met(O(2))(11)]-SP. NK-3 binding sites were labeled in adjacent sections with 2.5 nM [(3)H]senktide. NK-1 binding was found to be unaltered in 27 brain areas examined. In contrast, NK-3 binding was significantly reduced in layers 4 and 5 of the prefrontal (-46%), anterior cingulate (-42%) and parietal (-45%) cortices, ventromedial thalamus (-42%) and substantia nigra pars compacta (-36%) in dystonic brains compared to controls. The latter effects may be particularly relevant in view of evidence that activation of NK-3 receptors on dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta can increase nigrostriatal dopaminergic activity. Since previous studies indicated that a reduced basal ganglia output in mutant hamsters is based on an overactivity of the direct pathway which also innervates substantia nigra pars compacta neurons, the decreased NK-3 binding could be related to a receptor down-regulation. The present finding of decreased NK-3 receptor density in the substantia nigra pars compacta, thalamic and cortical areas substantiates the hypothesis that disturbances of the basal ganglia-thalamus-cortex circuit play a critical role in the pathogenesis of paroxysmal dystonia.""",7,"[[""dystonic""], [""paroxysmal dystonia""], [""hamster""], [""Sar""], [""dystonic""], [""dystonic brains""], [""primary dystonias""]]"

Five blinded raters (two fellowship-trained laryngologists and three speech/language pathologists) evaluated audio recordings of each patient pre- and post-DBS. Perceptual voice quality was rated using the Grade, Roughness, Breathiness, Asthenia, and Strain scale and changes in speech intelligibility were assessed with the Clinical Global Impression scale of Severity instrument. Inter-rater and intrarater reliability rates for perceptual voice ratings were assessed using the kappa coefficient.<h4>Results</h4>Voice quality parameters showed mean improvements in Grade (P < 0.0001), Roughness (P = 0.0043), and Strain (P < 0.0001) 12 months post-DBS. Asthenia increased from baseline to 6 months (P = 0.0022) and declined significantly from 6 to 12 months (P = 0.0170). Breathiness did not change significantly over time. Speech intelligibility also improved from 6 to 12 months (P = 0.0202) and from pre-DBS to 12 months post-DBS (P = 0.0022). Grade and Strain ratings had nearly perfect and substantial inter-rater agreement (0.84 and 0.71, respectively).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Voice and speech intelligibility improved after bilateral GPi DBS for dystonia.

"""33468570""","""Disease Modeling with Human Neurons Reveals LMNB1 Dysregulation Underlying DYT1 Dystonia.""","""DYT1 dystonia is a hereditary neurologic movement disorder characterized by uncontrollable muscle contractions. It is caused by a heterozygous mutation in <i>Torsin A</i> (<i>TOR1A</i>), a gene encoding a membrane-embedded ATPase. While animal models provide insights into disease mechanisms, significant species-dependent differences exist since animals with the identical heterozygous mutation fail to show pathology. Here, we model DYT1 by using human patient-specific cholinergic motor neurons (MNs) that are generated through either direct conversion of patients' skin fibroblasts or differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). These human MNs with the heterozygous <i>TOR1A</i> mutation show reduced neurite length and branches, markedly thickened nuclear lamina, disrupted nuclear morphology, and impaired nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT) of mRNAs and proteins, whereas they lack the perinuclear \""blebs\"" that are often observed in animal models. Furthermore, we uncover that the nuclear lamina protein LMNB1 is upregulated in DYT1 cells and exhibits abnormal subcellular distribution in a cholinergic MNs-specific manner. Such dysregulation of LMNB1 can be recapitulated by either ectopic expression of the mutant <i>TOR1A</i> gene or shRNA-mediated downregulation of endogenous <i>TOR1A</i> in healthy control MNs. Interestingly, downregulation of LMNB1 can largely ameliorate all the cellular defects in DYT1 MNs. These results reveal the value of disease modeling with human patient-specific neurons and indicate that dysregulation of LMNB1, a crucial component of the nuclear lamina, may constitute a major molecular mechanism underlying DYT1 pathology.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Inaccessibility to patient neurons greatly impedes our understanding of the pathologic mechanisms for dystonia. In this study, we employ reprogrammed human patient-specific motor neurons (MNs) to model DYT1, the most severe hereditary form of dystonia. Our results reveal disease-dependent deficits in nuclear morphology and nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT). Most importantly, we further identify LMNB1 dysregulation as a major contributor to these deficits, uncovering a new pathologic mechanism for DYT1 dystonia.""",7,"[[""human"", ""patients"", ""patient"", ""infant"", ""mammalian"", ""infants"", ""boy"", ""child"", ""woman"", ""humans"", ""children"", ""girl"", ""Mammal"", ""boys"", ""participants"", ""women"", ""man"", ""donor"", ""persons"", ""Men"", ""person"", ""people"", ""girls"", ""peoples"", ""participant"", ""outpatient"", ""donor variant"", ""patient variant"", ""mammalians"", ""Homo sapiens"", ""Pt"", ""Homo sapiens Linnaeus, 1758"", ""pts"", ""H. sapiens"", ""humans.

Presentation of data collection among all Italian neurosurgical institutions.<h4>Results</h4>Seven out of 123 Italian neurosurgical centres were enrolled. Sixty-nine patients were operated. According to different classification criteria, cases were grouped as follows: 37 primary and 32 secondary dystonia; 61 generalized and 8 focal dystonia; 16 patients aged at onset <2 years, 22 aged 3-12 years, 14 aged 13-20 years, 17 aged >20 years. Primary dystonia (DYT) mutation 1 was identified in 21% of primary generalized dystonia. Age at surgery was <15 years in 21.7% of cases (N.=15). Mean time between clinical onset and surgery was 17 years. Globus pallidus internus (GPi) was chosen for implantation in all cases. Type of anesthesia, method of target localization, lead and implanted pulse generator (IPG) model differed among centres. Surgical complications occurred in 19% of patients, but at a higher rate (33%) in the pediatric subgroup. Stimulation parameters varied among centres, but the main scheme was 90-120 micros and 130 Hz. Follow-up duration ranged from 3 to 84 months (longer than 24 months in 50% of patients). Mean Burke-Fahn-Marsden scale (BFM) improvement was 42% for both severity and disability score, ranging from 0% to 92%. Improvement of at least 50% in BFM severity score has been reached by 45% of primary and 37% of secondary dystonia. Clinical results were better in the DYT1 subgroup, with 60% of cases improving more than 50%. Among secondary dystonia, the drug-induced group had very good results too. On the contrary delayed surgery and presence of comorbidity were negatively correlated to the outcome.<h4>Conclusion</h4>In this series, primary generalized dystonia has a better outcome, especially if associated to DYT1 mutation.

However, the effectiveness of GPi-DBS in monozygotic twins with DYT1 dystonia has never been reported globally. Here, we report the cases of monozygotic twins with DYT1 dystonia who were treated using GPi-DBS, and we include a literature review. The younger brother showed an abnormal gait, with external rotation of the right lower leg at 6 years old. The symptoms gradually became so severe that he had difficulty walking on his own at 9 years of age. Treatment with levodopa-carbidopa partially resolved his symptoms, but most of the symptoms remained. Meanwhile, the older brother developed dystonia in both upper limbs at 8 years of age, with gradual symptom progression. At 13 years of age, they were diagnosed with DYT1 dystonia. Bilateral GPi-DBS was performed in both patients at 16 years of age. Their symptoms remarkably improved after surgery. The Burke-Fahn-Marsden dystonia rating scale (BFMDRS) movement score was reduced from 52 to 2 points for the younger brother and from 35 to 1 point for the older brother. Even if monozygotic twins have the same genes, the onset and severity of symptoms might vary in accordance with differences in epigenomic profiles. However, GPi-DBS treatment was very effective for the two cases; thus, we should consider the surgical interventions for each patient.""",7,"[[""patients""], [""patient""], [""dystonia""], [""Dystonia""], [""levodopa-carbidopa""], [""DYT1""], [""DYT1""]]"

Screening of this clone collection with cDNA probes from various brain and peripheral tissues resulted in the identification of 143 clones corresponding to 9q32-34-specific transcripts. Thirty three of these corresponded to transcripts expressed in a brain-specific manner and thus represent preferred candidates for the dystonia gene. None of these candidates were expressed specifically in the putative dystonia target tissue, basal ganglia.

Furthermore, both dystonia-associated mutations destabilize torsinA protein in dopaminergic cells. We find that wild-type torsinA protein is degraded primarily through the macroautophagy-lysosome pathway. In contrast, torsinA DeltaE and torsinA Delta323-8 mutant proteins are degraded by both the proteasome and macroautophagy-lysosome pathways.

We assessed intracortical inhibition (ICI), intracortical facilitation (ICF), the cortical silent period (SP) and spinal reciprocal inhibition (RI) in 10 manifesting DYT1 gene carriers (MDYT1), seven non-manifesting DYT1 gene carriers (NMDYT1) and 13 healthy controls.

Using (GT)n and RFLP markers in this region, we have identified obligate recombination events in some of these Jewish families, which further delineate the area containing the DYT1 gene to a 6-cM region bounded by loci AK1 and ASS. In 52 unrelated, affected Ashkenazi Jewish individuals, we have found highly significant linkage disequilibrium between a particular extended haplotype at the ABL-ASS loci and the DYT1 gene. The 4/A12 haplotype for ABL-ASS is present on 69% of the disease-bearing chromosomes among affected Jewish individuals and on only 1% of control Jewish chromosomes (chi 2 = 91.07, P much less than .001). The allelic association between this extended haplotype and DYT1 predicts that these three genes lie within 1-2 cM of each other; on the basis of obligate recombination events, the DYT1 gene is centromeric to ASS. Furthermore, this allelic association supports the idea that a single mutation event is responsible for most hereditary cases of dystonia in the Jewish population. Of the 53 definitely affected typed, 13 appear to be sporadic, with no family history of dystonia. However, the proportion of sporadic cases which potentially carry the A12 haplotype at ASS (8/13 [62%]) is similar to the proportion of familial cases with A12 (28/40 [70%]). This suggests that many sporadic cases are hereditary, that the disease gene frequency is greater than 1/15,000, and that the penetrance is lower than 30%, as previously estimated in this population. Most affected individuals were heterozygous for the ABL-ASS haplotype, a finding supporting autosomal dominant inheritance of the DYT1 gene. The ABL-ASS extended-haplotype status will provide predictive value for carrier status in Jewish individuals.

There is limited information, however, on outcomes after iMRI-guided DBS for dystonia. The authors evaluated clinical outcomes and targeting accuracy in patients with dystonia who underwent lead placement using an iMRI targeting platform.<h4>Methods</h4>Patients with dystonia undergoing iMRI-guided lead placement in the globus pallidus pars internus (GPi) were identified. Patients with a prior ablative or MER-guided procedure were excluded from clinical outcomes analysis. Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale (BFMDRS) scores and Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS) scores were assessed preoperatively and at 6 and 12 months postoperatively. Other measures analyzed include lead accuracy, complications/adverse events, and stimulation parameters.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 60 leads were implanted in 30 patients. Stereotactic lead accuracy in the axial plane was 0.93 ± 0.12 mm from the intended target. Nineteen patients (idiopathic focal, n = 7; idiopathic segmental, n = 5; DYT1, n = 1; tardive, n = 2; other secondary, n = 4) were included in clinical outcomes analysis. The mean improvement in BFMDRS score was 51.9% ± 9.7% at 6 months and 63.4% ± 8.0% at 1 year. TWSTRS scores in patients with predominant cervical dystonia (n = 13) improved by 53.3% ± 10.5% at 6 months and 67.6% ± 9.0% at 1 year. Serious complications occurred in 6 patients (20%), involving 8 of 60 implanted leads (13.3%). The rate of serious complications across all patients undergoing iMRI-guided DBS at the authors' institution was further reviewed, including an additional 53 patients undergoing GPi-DBS for Parkinson disease. In this expanded cohort, serious complications occurred in 11 patients (13.3%) involving 15 leads (10.1%).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Intraoperative MRI-guided lead placement in patients with dystonia showed improvement in clinical outcomes comparable to previously reported results using awake MER-guided lead placement. The accuracy of lead placement was high, and the procedure was well tolerated in the majority of patients. However, a number of patients experienced serious adverse events that were attributable to the introduction of a novel technique into a busy neurosurgical practice, and which led to the revision of protocols, product inserts, and on-site training.""",4,"[[""human"", ""patients"", ""patient"", ""infant"", ""mammalian"", ""infants"", ""boy"", ""child"", ""woman"", ""humans"", ""children"", ""girl"", ""Mammal"", ""boys"", ""participants"", ""women"", ""man"", ""donor"", ""persons"", ""Men"", ""person"", ""people"", ""girls"", ""peoples"", ""participant"", ""outpatient"", ""donor variant"", ""patient variant"", ""mammalians"", ""Homo sapiens"", ""Pt"", ""Homo sapiens Linnaeus, 1758"", ""pts"", ""H. sapiens"", ""humans.

Many subtypes of dystonias have been described, including monogenic forms (eg. DYT1 and DYT6), secondary dystonias related to metabolic disorders, forms due to brain lesions (including post-anoxic brain injury), and tardive dystonia. Dystonia may also be associated with myoclonus (myoclonus-dystonia, DYT11) or parkinsonism (rapid-onset dystonia parkinsonism DYT1). Paroxystic dystonias are a subgroup of paroxysmal dyskinesias. Diagnosis is based mainly on clinical features, age at onset, outcome, associated neurological signs, and brain MRI. Until recently, basal ganglia dysfunction and alterations of the sensory-motor network with maladaptive cortical plasticity were the core pathophysiological features of dystonia. Cerebellar and cerebello-thalamic anatomic-functional abnormalities may also play a role. The main objectives of this review are to highlight the principal characteristics of dystonias and to provide an overview of known culprit genes and environmental factors. Current pathophysiological knowledge, including anatomic-functional abnormalities, is summarized.""",3,"[[""DYT11""], [""DYT1""], [""DYT6""]]"

"""7979224""","""Dystonia in Ashkenazi Jews: clinical characterization of a founder mutation.""","""A gene (DYT1) for idiopathic torsion dystonia maps to chromosome 9q34 in Ashkenazi Jewish families with early onset of symptoms. Further, there is linkage disequilibrium between DYT1 and a particular haplotype of alleles at 9q34 loci in this population. This implies that a large proportion of early-onset idiopathic torsion dystonia in Ashkenazi Jews is due to a founder mutation in DYT1. To characterize the phenotypic range of this mutation, we studied 174 Ashkenazi Jewish individuals affected with idiopathic torsion dystonia. We used GT(n) markers on chromosome 9q34 (D9S62, D9S63, and ASS) and classified individuals as having (\""carriers\""), not having (\""noncarriers\""), or being ambiguous with respect to a DYT1-associated haplotype. We assessed clinical features and found marked clinical differences between haplotype carriers and noncarriers. There were 90 carriers, 70 noncarriers, and 14 ambiguous individuals. The mean age at onset of symptoms was significantly lower in carriers than in noncarriers (12.5 +/- 8.2 vs 36.5 +/- 16.4 years). In 94% of carriers, symptoms began in a limb (arm or leg equally); rarely the disorder started in the neck (3.3%) or larynx (2.2%). In contrast, the neck, larynx, and other cranial muscles were the sites of onset in 79% of noncarriers; onset in the arms occurred in 21% and onset in the legs never occurred. Limb onset, leg involvement in the course of disease, and age at onset distinguished haplotype carriers from noncarriers with 90% accuracy. In conclusion, there are clinical differences between Ashkenazi Jewish individuals with idiopathic torsion dystonia who do or do not have a unique DYT1 mutation, as determined by a DYT1-associated haplotype of 9q34 alleles.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)""",3,"[[""dystonia""], [""idiopathic torsion dystonia""], [""DYT1""]]"

Regional differences in brain function during task performance were assessed with simultaneous H(2) (15)O/PET. We found that motor performance was similar in the DYT1 and control groups, with no significant differences in movement time and spatial accuracy measured during each of the tasks. In contrast, sequence learning was reduced in gene carriers relative to controls (p < 0.01). PET imaging during motor execution showed increased activation in gene carriers (p < 0.001, uncorrected) in the left premotor cortex and right supplementary motor area, with concomitant reduction in the posterior medial cerebellum. During sequence learning, activation responses in DYT1 carriers were increased in the left ventral prefrontal cortex, and lateral cerebellum. These findings suggest that abnormalities in motor behavior and brain function exist in clinically nonmanifesting DYT1 carriers. Although localized increases in neural activity may enable normal movement execution in these subjects, this mechanism may not compensate for their defect in sequence learning.""",3,"[[""glucose""], [""dystonia""], [""DYT1""]]"
