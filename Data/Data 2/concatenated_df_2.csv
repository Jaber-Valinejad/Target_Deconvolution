Lung biopsy showed interstitial CD3+ lymphocyte infiltration, foamy histiocytes, noncaseating granulomas, and luminal obstruction described as cryptogenic organizing pneumonia. At age 16, she developed enterocolitis associated with interstitial infiltrate of CD3+ T cells. Since childhood she had recurrent sinopulmonary, ear, skin, and urinary tract infections, chronic nasal congestion, eczema, and recurrent colitis. She also had hypogammaglobulinemia, thrombocytopenia, various lymphopenias, eosinophilia, lymphadenopathy, and splenomegaly. Vaccination responses were protective. She developed autoimmune hemolytic anemia and recurrent autoimmune cytopenias requiring treatment with rituximab; she also received immunoglobulin replacement therapy. Detailed immunologic workup showed reduced memory B cells, reduced memory and effector CD8+ T cells, decreased T-regulatory cells (Tregs), and impaired T-cell response to TCR stimulation. There was a bias toward a Th1-type cellular state with increased levels of CXCR3 ({300574})-expressing CD4+ T cells that are involved in homing to inflamed tissues. Serum levels of inflammatory cytokines were increased, including IL18 ({600953}), CCL1 ({182281}), and TNFA ({191160}). Some of the patient's features were suggestive of common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), but the lung-gut disease with pathologic accumulation of T cells together with some of the laboratory results were consistent with immune dysregulation and hyperinflammation. Although some of these features were observed in Pik3cg-null mice, there were also some differences, which may have been influenced by environmental factors (see ANIMAL MODEL).

Hemophagocytosis indicative of macrophage activation was visible in the bone marrow aspirate, but the disease was distinct from classic HLH. Laboratory studies showed numerous immunologic cellular defects, including mild lymphopenia, decreased numbers of NK cells, decreased NK cell degranulation, impaired T-cell activation and proliferation in response to TCR signaling, mildly increased regulatory T cells, and diminished phagocytosis in monocytes and neutrophils.

It is a genetically heterogeneous autoimmune disease affecting about 0.3% of Caucasian populations ({138:Todd, 1990}). Genetic studies of T1D have focused on the identification of loci associated with increased susceptibility to this multifactorial phenotype.

The classic phenotype of diabetes mellitus is polydipsia, polyphagia, and polyuria which result from hyperglycemia-induced osmotic diuresis and secondary thirst. These derangements result in long-term complications that affect the eyes, kidneys, nerves, and blood vessels.","The term diabetes mellitus is not precisely defined and the lack of a consensus on diagnostic criteria has made its genetic analysis difficult. Diabetes mellitus is classified clinically into 2 major forms of the primary illness, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM; {125853}), and secondary forms related to gestation or medical disorders.

Appearance of the IDDM phenotype is thought to require a predisposing genetic background and interaction with other environmental factors. {111:Rotter and Rimoin (1978)} hypothesized that there are at least 2 forms of IDDM: a B8 (DR3)-associated form characterized by pancreatic autoimmunity, and a B15-associated form characterized by antibody response to exogenous insulin. Interestingly, the DR3 and DR4 alleles seem to have a synergistic effect on the predisposition to IDDM based on the greatly increased risk observed in persons having both the B8 and B15 antigens ({129:Svejgaard and Ryder, 1977}). {112:Rotter and Rimoin (1979)} hypothesized a combined form. {139:Tolins and Raij (1988)} cited clinical and experimental evidence to support the idea that those IDDM patients in whom diabetic nephropathy (see {603933}) eventually develops may have a genetic predisposition to essential hypertension.

{47:Gambelunghe et al. (2001)} noted heterogeneity of the clinical and immunologic features of IDDM in relation to age at clinical onset. Childhood IDDM is characterized by an abrupt onset and ketosis and is associated with HLA-DRB1*04-DQA1*0301-DQB1*0302 and a high frequency of insulin and IA-2 autoantibodies. On the other hand, the so-called latent autoimmune diabetes of the adult (LADA) is a slowly progressive form of adult-onset autoimmune diabetes that is noninsulin-dependent at the time of clinical diagnosis and is characterized by the presence of glutamic acid decarboxylase-65 (GAD65: {138275}) autoantibodies and/or islet cell antibodies.",0.41,0.55,"['Diabetes mellitus, insulin-dependent', 'HNF1A', ' TCF1', ' MODY3', ' IDDM20']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

<Subhead> Genetic Heterogeneity of Susceptibility to Type 2 Diabetes

Susceptibility to T2D1 ({601283}) is conferred by variation in the calpain-10 gene (CAPN10; {605286}) on chromosome 2q37. The T2D2 locus ({601407}) on chromosome 12q was found in a Finnish population. The T2D3 locus ({603694}) maps to chromosome 20. The T2D4 locus ({608036}) maps to chromosome 5q34-q35. Susceptibility to T2D5 ({616087}) is conferred by variation in the TBC1D4 gene ({612465}) on chromosome 13q22.

A mutation has been observed in hepatocyte nuclear factor-4-alpha (HNF4A; {600281.0004}) in a French family with NIDDM of late onset. Mutations in the NEUROD1 gene ({601724}) on chromosome 2q32 were found to cause type 2 diabetes mellitus in 2 families. Mutation in the GLUT2 glucose transporter was associated with NIDDM in 1 patient ({138160.0001}). Mutation in the MAPK8IP1 gene, which encodes the islet-brain-1 protein, was found in a family with type 2 diabetes in individuals in 4 successive generations ({604641.0001}). Polymorphism in the KCNJ11 gene ({600937.0014}) confers susceptibility. In French white families, {84:Vionnet et al. (2000)} found evidence for a susceptibility locus for type 2 diabetes on 3q27-qter. They confirmed the diabetes susceptibility locus on 1q21-q24 reported by {17:Elbein et al.

A mutation in the GPD2 gene ({138430.0001}) on chromosome 2q24.1, encoding mitochondrial glycerophosphate dehydrogenase, was found in a patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus and in his glucose-intolerant half sister. Mutations in the PAX4 gene ({167413}) have been identified in patients with type 2 diabetes. {79:Triggs-Raine et al. (2002)} stated that in the Oji-Cree, a gly319-to-ser change in HNF1-alpha ({142410.0008}) behaves as a susceptibility allele for type 2 diabetes. Mutation in the HNF1B gene ({189907.0007}) was found in 2 Japanese patients with typical late-onset type 2 diabetes. Mutations in the IRS1 gene ({147545}) have been found in patients with type 2 diabetes. A missense mutation in the AKT2 gene ({164731.0001}) caused autosomal dominant type 2 diabetes in 1 family. A (single-nucleotide polymorphism) SNP in the 3-prime untranslated region of the resistin gene ({605565.0001}) was associated with susceptibility to diabetes and to insulin resistance-related hypertension in Chinese subjects. Susceptibility to insulin resistance has been associated with polymorphism in the TCF1 ({142410.0011}), PPP1R3A ({600917.0001}), PTPN1 ({176885.0001}), ENPP1 ({173335.0006}), IRS1 ({147545.0002}), and EPHX2 ({132811.0001}) genes. The K121Q polymorphism of ENPP1 ({173335.0006}) is associated with susceptibility to type 2 diabetes; a haplotype defined by 3 SNPs of this gene, including K121Q, is associated with obesity, glucose intolerance, and type 2 diabetes. A SNP in the promoter region of the hepatic lipase gene ({151670.0004}) predicts conversion from impaired glucose tolerance to type 2 diabetes. Variants of transcription factor 7-like-2 (TCF7L2; {602228.0001}), located on 10q, have also been found to confer risk of type 2 diabetes. A common sequence variant, {dbSNP rs10811661}, on chromosome 9p21 near the CDKN2A ({600160}) and CDKN2B ({600431}) genes has been associated with risk of type 2 diabetes. Variation in the PPARG gene ({601487}) has been associated with risk of type 2 diabetes. A promoter polymorphism in the IL6 gene ({147620}) is associated with susceptibility to NIDDM. Variation in the KCNJ15 gene ({602106}) has been associated with T2DM in lean Asians. Variation in the SLC30A8 gene ({611145}) has been associated with susceptibility to T2D. Variation in the HMGA1 gene ({600701.0001}) is associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Mutation in the MTNR1B gene ({600804}) is associated with susceptibility to type 2 diabetes.

In addition to lifestyle and environmental risk factors, gene defects can contribute to an inherited predisposition to CRC. CRC is caused by changes in different molecular pathogenic pathways, such as chromosomal instability, CpG island methylator phenotype, and microsatellite instability. Chromosome instability is the most common alteration and is present in almost 85% of all cases (review by {62:Schweiger et al., 2013}).

<Subhead> Genetic Heterogeneity of Colorectal Cancer

Mutations in a single gene result in a marked predisposition to colorectal cancer in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP; {175100}) and hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC; see {120435}). FAP is caused by mutations in the APC gene ({611731}), whereas HNPCC is caused by mutations in several genes, including MSH2 ({609309}), MLH1 ({120436}), PMS1 ({600258}), PMS2 ({600259}), MSH6 ({600678}), TGFBR2 ({190182}), and MLH3 ({604395}). Epigenetic silencing of MSH2 results in a form of HNPCC (see HNPCC8, {613244}). Other colorectal cancer syndromes include autosomal recessive adenomatous polyposis ({608456}), which is caused by mutations in the MUTYH gene ({604933}), and oligodontia-colorectal cancer syndrome ({608615}), which is caused by mutations in the AXIN2 gene ({604025}). Colorectal cancer is a predominant form of cancer in tumor predisposition syndrome-4 (TPDS4; {609265}), which is caused by mutation in the CHEK2 gene ({604373}). A germline mutation in the PLA2G2A gene ({172411}) was identified in a patient with colorectal cancer.

Germline susceptibility loci for colorectal cancer have also been identified. CRCS1 ({608812}) is conferred by mutation in the GALNT12 gene ({610290}) on chromosome 9q22; CRCS2 ({611469}) maps to chromosome 8q24; CRCS3 ({612229}) is conferred by variation in the SMAD7 gene ({602932}) on chromosome 18; CRCS4 ({601228}) is conferred by variation on 15q that causes increased and ectopic expression of the GREM1 gene ({603054}); CRCS5 ({612230}) maps to chromosome 10p14; CRCS6 ({612231}) maps to chromosome 8q23; CRCS7 ({612232}) maps to chromosome 11q23; CRCS8 ({612589}) maps to chromosome 14q22; CRCS9 ({612590}) maps to 16q22; CRCS10 ({612591}) is conferred by mutation in the POLD1 gene ({174761}) on chromosome 19q13; CRCS11 ({612592}) maps to chromosome 20p12; and CRCS12 ({615083}) is conferred by mutation in the POLE gene ({174762}) on chromosome 12q24.

Cancer of the colon occurred in 7 members of 4 successive generations of the family reported by {33:Kluge (1964)}, leading him to suggest a simple genetic basis for colonic cancer independent of polyposis. The combination of colonic and endometrial cancer has been observed in many families (e.g., {76:Williams, 1978}).

{65:Sivak et al. (1981)} studied a kindred with the familial cancer syndrome in which every confirmed affected member had at least 1 primary carcinoma of the colon. The average age at which cancer appeared was 38 years. Multiple primary neoplasms occurred in 23% of cancer patients.

{10:Budd and Fink (1981)} reported a family with a high frequency of mucoid colonic carcinoma. Since endometrial carcinoma, atypical endometrial hyperplasia, uterine leiomyosarcoma, bladder transitional carcinoma, and renal cell carcinoma also occurred in the family, this may be the same disorder as the Lynch cancer family syndrome type II ({120435}).

{2:Bamezai et al. (1984)} reported an Indian Sikh kindred in which 8 persons suffered from cancer of the cecum, not associated with polyposis.

{11:Burt et al. (1985)} studied a large Utah kindred called to attention because of occurrence of colorectal cancer in a brother, a sister, and a nephew. No clear inheritance pattern was discernible until systematic screening was undertaken for colonic polyps using flexible proctosigmoidoscopy. One or more adenomatous polyps were found in 41 of 191 family members (21%) and 12 of 132 controls (9%)--p less than 0.005. Pedigree analysis showed best fit with autosomal dominant inheritance. {13:Cannon-Albright et al. (1988)} extended the studies with investigations of 33 additional kindreds. The kindreds were selected through either a single person with an adenomatous polyp or a cluster of relatives with colonic cancer. The kindreds all had common colorectal cancers, not the rare inherited condition of familial polyposis coli or nonpolyposis inherited colorectal cancer. Likelihood analysis strongly supported dominant inheritance of a susceptibility to colorectal adenomas and cancers, with a gene frequency of 19%. According to the most likely genetic model, adenomatous polyps and colorectal cancers occur only in genetically susceptible persons; however, the 95% confidence interval for this proportion was 53 to 100%.

{55:Ponz de Leon et al. (1992)} analyzed data on 605 families of probands with colorectal cancer in the province of Modena in Italy. Among the 577 presumed nonpolyposis cases, both parents had colorectal cancer in 11, one parent in 130, and neither parent in 436. Segregation was compatible with dominant transmission of susceptibility to cancer.

{45:Mecklin (1987)} investigated the frequency of hereditary colorectal cancer among all colorectal cancer patients diagnosed in 1 Finnish county during the 1970s. The cancer family syndrome type of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal carcinoma emerged as the most common verifiable risk factor, involving between 3.8 and 5.5% of all colorectal cancer patients. The frequencies of familial adenomatosis and ulcerative colitis were 0.2% and 0.6%, respectively. The observed frequency is probably an underestimate. The patients with cancer family syndrome were young, accounting for 29 to 39% of the patients under 50 years of age, and their tumors were located predominantly (65%) in the right hemicolon.",0.6,0.51,"['Colon cancer, advanced, somatic', 'SRC', ' ASV', ' SRC1', ' THC6']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, it is not known why some individuals have disseminated TB that spreads to the meninges and central nervous system, while most people have localized disease in the lungs.

<Subhead> Occurrence of Pancreatic Cancer in Other Disorders

Several familial cancer syndromes increase the risk of pancreatic cancer. The best characterized include hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer syndrome (HNPCC; see {120435}); hereditary breast-ovarian cancer syndrome due to mutations in BRCA2; Peutz-Jeghers syndrome ({175200}); the melanoma-pancreatic cancer syndrome ({606719}), caused by mutations in CDKN2A ({600160}); von Hippel-Lindau syndrome ({193300}), ataxia-telangiectasia ({208900}) ({41:Swift et al., 1976}), and juvenile polyposis syndrome ({174900}).

Patients with hereditary pancreatitis ({167800}) resulting from gain-of-function mutations in the protease serine-1 gene (PRSS1; {276000}) have a lifetime pancreatic cancer risk ratio of 57 and a cumulative incidence, to age 70 years, of 40% ({27:Lowenfels et al., 1997}).","{18:Friedman and Fialkow (1976)} observed cancer of the pancreas in 4 brothers from a sibship of 6. Diagnosis was made between ages 66 and 75 years. None had a history of pancreatitis or tumors at other sites.

{36:Reimer et al. (1977)} reported pancreatic cancer in father and son.

In a family of European Jewish ancestry, {15:Ehrenthal et al. (1987)} identified pancreatic adenocarcinoma in women of 3 successive generations. The diagnosis was histologically confirmed in each case. The youngest of the 3 women presented at age 29, her mother at age 42, and her grandmother at age 76.

{28:Lynch et al. (1995)} studied 8 families in which 2 or more first-degree relatives had pancreatic cancer. In the 8 families, 25 pancreatic cancers were found. The mean age of occurrence was 62.8 years, with a range from 45 to 90 years. Parent and child occurrence was observed in 4 of the 8 families. In one family, the progenitor had an affected brother and 5 of his 8 children developed cancer; 2 had pancreatic cancer, 2 had breast cancer (one of these also had pancreatic cancer), and 1 daughter had ovarian cancer. Of the 7 carcinomas available for pathologic review, 6 were typical ductal adenocarcinomas and the seventh was a giant cell variant of ductal carcinoma.

{12:Caldas et al. (1994)} quoted {11:Boring et al. (1993)} as indicating that pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in either sex in the United States, with an estimated incidence in 1993 of nearly 27,700 and a mortality of 24,500.

{17:Evans et al. (1995)} described a large pedigree in which pancreatic cancer was inherited as an autosomal dominant. Diabetes and exocrine insufficiency were observed in all family members who eventually developed pancreatic cancer. The presence of diabetes, often years before the diagnosis of cancer, allowed identification of those people who had inherited the predisposing allele. The lack of attacks of abdominal pain seemingly distinguishes the affected members of this family from hereditary pancreatitis ({167800}) in which diabetes mellitus and pancreatic cancer occur, but the distinction is by no means clear because it was stated that 6 of the 9 persons who developed pancreatic cancer in this family also had a history clinically compatible with pancreatic insufficiency before diagnosis of cancer: weight loss, fatty and foul smelling stools, increased fecal fat, and relief with exogenous pancreatic enzyme supplementation.

Most or perhaps all populations of the world are polymorphic for 'rapid inactivation' versus 'slow inactivation.' As shown by the study of {8:Evans et al. (1960)}, the 'slow inactivator' person is homozygous for a slow inactivator allele; the 'rapid inactivator' person may be either homozygous or heterozygous for a rapid inactivator allele. The method described by {44:Sunahara et al. (1961)} permitted separation of the homozygotes and heterozygotes, i.e., 3 genotypes in all. The rapid versus slow acetylation of sulfadiazine in rabbits ({11:Frymoyer and Jacox, 1963}) is similar. The polymorphism in acetylation extends to the acetylation of sulfamethazine, which can be used as a test ({35:Parker, 1969}). Isoniazid, hydralazine, and some sulfa drugs are acetylated by a common mechanism ({9:Evans and White, 1964}). Administration of INH with phenytoin (Dilantin) results in high, even toxic levels of the anticonvulsant ({22:Kutt et al., 1970}), and the effects of the drug interaction are greater in slow acetylators. Hydralazine (Apresoline) is acetylated through the INH-type mechanism, as is procainamide (Pronestyl). INH hepatotoxicity is more frequent in slow inactivators ({46:Timbrell et al., 1977}).

{30:McLaren et al.

(1979)} could find no relation between acetylator phenotype and proneness to develop SLE-like syndrome. {38:Reidenberg et al. (1980)} found an excess of slow acetylator phenotype in SLE. On the other hand, {3:Baer et al. (1986)} could find no association between acetylator phenotype and SLE and from a review of the literature concluded that most workers have had similar results.

{15:Harmer et al. (1986)} found no correlation between the acetylator and the sparteine hydroxylation phenotypes. This is perhaps not surprising inasmuch as the N-acetyltransferase enzyme is cytosolic in liver and jejunal mucosa, whereas the polymorphic enzyme that governs hydroxylation of sparteine, debrisoquine, and other drugs is a liver P450 ({124030}). In addition to isoniazid, {15:Harmer et al. (1986)} listed the following drugs as being acetylated by the polymorphic enzyme: sulfadimidine, hydralazine, dapsone, procaine amide, sulfapyridine, a reduced metabolite of nitrazepam, and a metabolite of caffeine. {33:Nhachi (1988)} found bimodality for percent urinary sulfamethazine acetylated in a 6-hour sample in a Zimbabwe population. The allele for slow acetylation was estimated to have a frequency of 0.72.

{39:Roberts-Thomson et al. (1996)} found that the fast acetylator phenotype was associated with odds ratios of 1.1 and 1.8 for adenoma and colorectal cancer, respectively. The highest risk occurred in the youngest tertile (less than 64 years) of cases. There was no difference between the sexes. The risk of adenoma or cancer increased with increasing intake of meat in fast but not in slow acetylators. The findings suggested that acetylator status modulates the risk of colorectal neoplasia associated with meat intake.

{42:Schnakenberg et al. (1998)} analyzed the NAT2 gene of blood and tumor DNA from 60 patients with primary bladder cancer and DNA of blood samples from 154 healthy individuals. They found that 70% of patients with bladder cancer were slow acetylators, while genotyping of controls resulted in 61% with slow acetylation. In addition, dividing bladder cancer patients in males and females, the genotype NAT2*5B/NAT2*6A occurred with much higher frequencies in males. Furthermore, investigating bladder cancer tissues, they detected loss of heterozygosity in slow and rapid acetylator genotypes. In 11 of 60 tumor samples (18.3%), they observed allelic loss at the NAT2 locus, while in control DNA of blood from the same patients both alleles were still detectable.",,0.45,"['Acetylation, slow', 'NAT2', ' AAC2']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism can be caused by an isolated defect in gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GNRH; {152760}) release, action, or both. Other associated nonreproductive phenotypes, such as anosmia, cleft palate, and sensorineural hearing loss, occur with variable frequency. In the presence of anosmia, idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism has been called 'Kallmann syndrome (KS),' whereas in the presence of a normal sense of smell, it has been termed 'normosmic idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (nIHH)' (summary by {17:Raivio et al., 2007}). Because families have been found to segregate both KS and nIHH, the disorder is here referred to as 'hypogonadotropic hypogonadism with or without anosmia (HH).'

(1997)} studied a brother and sister with normosmic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. The 22-year-old propositus was referred because of hypogonadism and impaired libido, who had undergone puberty at age 16. His height was 180 cm and his arm span 186 cm. Physical examination revealed absence of facial hair, sparse pubic hair (Tanner stage 3), and a penis of 6 cm. He had scrotal testes, and the volume of each was 8 ml (normal, 15 to 25 ml). There was no gynecomastia. He had a normal sense of smell and no mirror movements of the upper limbs, no abnormal eye movements, no colorblindness, and no renal or craniofacial abnormalities. The karyotype was 46,XY. The patient's 37-year-old sister had a history of primary amenorrhea and infertility. Spontaneous thelarche had occurred at age 14 years. She had a single episode of uterine bleeding at age 18, and afterward received combined oral contraceptive treatment. This treatment was interrupted when she desired children. However, amenorrhea and absence of pregnancy led to ovulation-inducing treatment, which resulted in 2 normal pregnancies and the births of a girl and a boy, 4 and 7 years old at the time of report. After each pregnancy, she had persistent amenorrhea, and oral contraceptive treatment was resumed. Her height was 165 cm. Pubic hair development was at Tanner stage 5, and her breasts and external genitalia were those of a normal woman. Both parents and a sister were clinically and endocrinologically normal.

{3:Caron et al. (1999)} studied 3 sibs with mutations in GNRHR from a kindred with isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. The 2 brothers, who were referred for lack of puberty, had microphallus and bilateral cryptorchidism; their sister had primary amenorrhea and a complete lack of puberty. The authors concluded that these hypogonadal patients were partially resistant to pulsatile GNRH administration, suggesting that they should instead be treated with gonadotropins to induce spermatogenesis or ovulation.

{14:Pitteloud et al. (2001)} reported a 26-year-old male with a mild form of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, which they called a 'fertile eunuch variant' of HH. The proband had hypogonadal testosterone levels, detectable but apulsatile gonadotropin secretion, and a normal adult male testicular size of 17 mL at baseline. After only 4 months of treatment with chorionic gonadotropin (CG; see {118860}) alone, he developed sperm in his ejaculate, and his wife conceived. Following cessation of CG therapy, the patient demonstrated reversal of his hypogonadotropism as evidenced by normal adult male testosterone levels and the appearance of pulsatile luteinizing hormone (LH; see {152780}) secretion. The authors concluded that this case expanded the clinical spectrum of GNRHR mutations, providing the first genetic basis for the fertile eunuch variant of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and documenting the occurrence of reversible hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in a patient with a GNRHR mutation.

Gonadotropin concentrations were normal or low, but in both cases were restored to normal levels by a single injection of GNRH. In both sisters, there were no spontaneous pulses of LH, but pulsatile administration of GNRH provoked pulsatile secretion of LH in the younger one.

The thiopurines are prodrugs that require extensive metabolism in order to exert their cytotoxic action. Azathioprine is nonenzymatically reduced to 6MP. 6MP and 6TG are activated by HPRT ({308000}) and subsequent steps to form cytotoxic thioguanine nucleotides (TGNs) which are incorporated into DNA and/or RNA, causing DNA-protein cross-links, single-strand breaks, interstrand cross-links, and sister chromatid exchange. TPMT functions mainly to inactivate these drugs; thus, a deficiency of TPMT results in increased conversion to toxic TGNs, which can result in myelosuppression ({3:Coulthard and Hogarth, 2005}). However, 6MP is unique in that it can also be converted via TPMT into a methyl-thioinosine 5-prime monophosphate (MeTIMP), a metabolite that inhibits de novo purine synthesis and likely contributes to the cytotoxic effect of 6MP ({17:Vogt et al., 1993}; {7:Krynetski et al., 1995}; {3:Coulthard and Hogarth, 2005}).

See also THPM2 ({616903}), caused by variation in the NUDT15 gene ({615792}) on chromosome 13q14.","{12,11:Lennard et al. (1987, 1990)} found a significant negative correlation between erythrocyte cytotoxic TGNs and TPMT activity among children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treated with 6MP. Two of 3 adult patients with very high TGN concentrations and 6MP-induced leukopenia had no detectable TPMT activity, presumed to be an inherited deficiency of the enzyme ({12:Lennard et al., 1987}). Children with low concentrations of TGNs had higher TPMT activity and a higher subsequent relapse rate ({11:Lennard et al., 1990}). {12,11:Lennard et al. (1987, 1990)} concluded that individuals with inherited low TPMT activity may be at risk for increased TGNs and acute myelosuppression when treated with standard doses of thiopurine drugs. In addition, genetically determined TPMT activity may regulate the cytotoxic effect of 6MP and thus influence outcome of therapy for childhood ALL.

{13:Lennard et al. (1989)} reported 5 patients treated with standard doses of azathioprine who developed acute myelosuppression. Compared to control patients who did not develop myelosuppression, the 5 patients had very low TPMT activities and abnormally high levels of cytotoxic thioguanine nucleotides, consistent with inherited low TPMT activity.

{5:Evans et al. (1991)} reported an 8-year-old girl who developed severe hematopoietic toxicity with conventional oral doses of 6-mercaptopurine for treatment of ALL. {10:Lennard et al. (1993)} reported 2 unrelated children with ALL taking 6MP who developed profound myelosuppression on 25% of the standard protocol dose. Both were found to have undetectable intracellular TPMT activity and both produced higher cytotoxic drug metabolites at decreased 6MP dosage compared to other patients taking 100% of the dose. {10:Lennard et al. (1993)} concluded that both children had the recessive trait lacking TPMT activity and noted the importance of recognizing such individuals in order to avoid fatal bone marrow failure through inadvertent overdosage.

{14:Schutz et al. (1993)} reported azathioprine-induced myelosuppression in a heart transplant recipient with TPMT deficiency. {9:Leipold et al. (1997)} reported a 14-year-old girl who developed severe pancytopenia 7 weeks after starting azathioprine for HLA-B27-associated juvenile spondyloarthritis (see {106300}). She was found to have toxic levels of 6-thioguanine nucleotides and was TPMT-deficient. Withdrawal of azathioprine allowed recovery 8 weeks later.

{2:Black et al. (1998)} found that 6 (9%) of 67 patients with autoimmune disease taking AZA were heterozygous for a mutant TPMT allele. Five of the 6 patients discontinued treatment within 1 month because of low leukocyte levels. The authors concluded that TPMT heterozygotes taking AZA are at increased risk for adverse side effects.

Of 23 patients who developed excessive toxicity while taking 6MP or AZA, {4:Evans et al. (2001)} found that 6 were homozygous for TPMT deficiency, 9 were heterozygous, and 8 had normal TPMT activity (homozygous wildtype). The 65% frequency of homozygous or heterozygous individuals among these patients was significantly greater than the expected 10% in the general population. Hematologic toxicity occurred in more than 90% of the patients, while hepatotoxicity occurred in 6 (26%) patients. Dosage adjustment in these patients resulted in tolerance of treatment without toxicity. {15:Schwab et al. (2002)} found that 3 (60%) of 5 patients who developed hematopoietic toxicity from azathioprine had 1 or more TPMT variant alleles. {6:Evans (2002)} commented that this overrepresentation of TPMT variant alleles in patients developing hematopoietic toxicity with thiopurine therapy was consistent with their findings ({4:Evans et al., 2001}). In addition, both studies showed that hematopoietic toxicity can occur in TPMT heterozygotes, not just homozygous-deficient patients.

Failure of the uterus to respond to progesterone would lead to the development of a 'constantly proliferative' endometrium incompatible with blastocyst implantation. Partial resistance to progesterone, on the other hand, would be expected to be associated with various degrees of incomplete maturation of the endometrium, perhaps expressed clinically as infertility or early abortions. The syndrome would present with the clinical and histologic picture of a luteal phase defect in which the life span of the corpus luteum and the plasma progesterone concentrations would be normal or elevated.","The first report of a well-studied patient with progesterone resistance was by {3:Keller et al. (1979)}. Their patient was an infertile woman with a normal menstrual cycle, a normal luteal phase duration, and normal plasma immunoreactive LH and progesterone concentrations. The endometrium was histologically immature. A decreased concentration of endometrial progesterone receptors (PGR; {607311}) on day 14 of the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle was suggested by the studies.

{2:Chrousos et al. (1986)} stated that the patient of {3:Keller et al. (1979)} was the only one in whom progesterone receptors had been examined; however, a similar defect had been proposed in other patients. Compensated progesterone resistance due to reduced progesterone receptor concentrations has been found in female squirrel monkeys and other New World primate species ({2:Chrousos et al., 1986}).",0.17,0.49,"['Progesterone resistance', 'PGR']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Independently, {2:Mueller et al. (2019)} studied the same 2 Polish boys reported by {1:Kutkowska-Kazmierczak et al.

Parents in both families mentioned an intermittent 'strange' body odor. The older patient also had thickened fingernails that split into horizontal layers; palms, soles, scalp, and mucous membranes were spared. Biopsy of affected skin from patient 1 showed ichthyosis, with thickening of the stratum corneum and spinosum, and electron microscopy revealed numerous lysosomes filled with lipopigment. Both patients also had progressive high frequency hearing deficit with onset in the first decade of life, and both exhibited horizontal nystagmus. Patient 1 had marked photophobia, progressive difficulty with night vision, and visual field constriction. Spectral domain-optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) showed thinning of the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer in both patients; electroretinographic responses were normal. Both patients were wheelchair-dependent and had dysarthric speech. Neurologic examination of patient 1 at age 14 years revealed hyperreflexia, upgoing plantar reflexes, contractures of large joints, and equinovarus foot deformity. His arms were less severely affected, but showed some some contractures and muscle atrophy, although he was an elite wheelchair athlete. Patient 1 also reported intermittent stool incontinence and incomplete bladder voiding, and urodynamic investigation showed neurogenic bladder with detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia. Cranial MRIs showed nonprogressive hypomyelination in the posterior limb of the internal capsule and in the optic radiation in both patients, and somatosensory and acoustic evoked potentials were consistent with a brainstem and central conduction defect.

{3:Takahashi et al. (2022)} reported 2 sibs, born of consanguineous Turkish parents, with IKSHD transmitted in an autosomal recessive pattern. The patients, who were 9 and 5 years old, had delayed motor development with progressive tremor, spasticity of the lower limbs, involuntary movements, and pyramidal signs resulting in the inability to walk. Other features included cerebellar dysarthria, horizontal nystagmus, and ataxic tremor of the extremities. Motor and sensory nerve conduction studies were normal.

Although it affects emotions, it is distinguished from mood disorders in which such disturbances are primary. Similarly, there may be mild impairment of cognitive function, and it is distinguished from the dementias in which disturbed cognitive function is considered primary. There is no characteristic pathology, such as neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer disease ({104300}). Schizophrenia is a common disorder with a lifetime prevalence of approximately 1%. It is highly heritable but the genetics are complex. This may not be a single entity.

Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (see {125480}) are generally considered to be separate entities, but patients who exhibit multiple symptoms of both disorders are often given the hybrid diagnosis schizoaffective disorder ({13:Blacker and Tsuang, 1992}).

<Subhead> Genetic Heterogeneity of Schizophrenia with or without an Affective Disorder

For associations pending confirmation, see MAPPING and MOLECULAR GENETICS.","Schizophrenia is characterized by a constellation of symptoms including hallucinations and delusions (psychotic symptoms) and symptoms such as severely inappropriate emotional responses, disordered thinking and concentration, erratic behavior, as well as social and occupational deterioration. It often develops in young adults who were previously normal ({2:Andreasen, 1995}).

In his first description of dementia praecox, Kraepelin identified subtypes of schizophrenia: hebephrenic, catatonic, and paranoid ({43:Diefendorf, 1902}). The utility and validity of these subtypes was long a subject of debate. {94:Kendler et al. (1994)} sought to clarify differences in outcome and familial psychopathology among these 3 subtypes in the Roscommon Family Study of severe mental illness conducted in a rural county in western Ireland. They found that the subtypes did not 'breed true' within families. They concluded that from a familial perspective the subtypes are not etiologically distinct syndromes.

{93:Kendler and Hays (1982)} compared a group of 30 patients with familial schizophrenia (defined as having an affected first-degree relative) and a group of 83 cases of sporadic schizophrenia. No difference in the intensity of (1) flattened, depressed, or elevated affect, (2) auditory hallucinations, or (3) delusions was found; however, more of the familial (56.7%) than of the sporadic (18.1%) schizophrenic patients had severe thought disorders. EEGs performed while the patients were taking neuroleptics showed abnormality in 72.3% of sporadic cases and 43.3% of familial cases.

Extrapyramidal signs such as bradykinesia, rigidity, or dyskinesias in patients with schizophrenia are usually attributed to antipsychotic drugs, many of which are dopamine-receptor antagonists. {26:Chatterjee et al. (1995)} prospectively studied 89 patients presenting with a first episode of schizophrenia who had never taken neuroleptic medications. Using the Simpson Dyskinesia Rating Scale, they found 16.9% (15) of these individuals to have significant extrapyramidal dysfunction on presentation. Twelve of the patients had akinesia, 6 had rigidity, 1 had cogwheeling, and 1 had mild spontaneous dyskinesia. These observations gave support to earlier proposals that the basal ganglia may be involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.

{102:Kunugi et al. (1994)} found no significant difference in head circumference at birth between 64 infants who later developed schizophrenia and 45 of their healthy sibs. {136:Nopoulos et al. (1995)} demonstrated decreased volume of the frontal lobe and increased volume of the intersulcal CSF in 12 males and 12 females presenting with a first episode of schizophrenia, compared to 24 controls matched for age, height, weight, parental social class, and paternal and maternal education.

Eye movement disturbances have been found in about 40 to 80% of patients with schizophrenia, about 25 to 40% of their healthy first-degree relatives, and in less than 10% of healthy control subjects ({78:Holzman, 2000}).

Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder ({125480}) are generally considered to be separate entities, but patients who exhibit multiple symptoms of both disorders are often given the hybrid diagnosis schizoaffective disorder ({13:Blacker and Tsuang, 1992}). The clinical features of such patients supported the argument that schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are variant expressions of a diathesis, in part because of the similar disease frequencies, ages at onset, and absence of sex bias in the 2 disorders.

{70:Hallmayer et al. (2005)} pointed out that {100:Kraepelin (1909)} viewed the disorder he termed dementia praecox as a cognitive disorder. Coining the term schizophrenia to replace dementia praecox, {15:Bleuler (1920)} emphasized that it 'is not a disease in the strict sense, but appears to be a group of diseases...Therefore we should speak of schizophrenias in the plural.' {70:Hallmayer et al. (2005)} stated that the inherent heterogeneity originally recognized has been obfuscated in modern diagnostic classifications, which are designed to meet the needs of patient management, not fundamental research, and which may not target phenotypes anchored in the biology of the illness.

The ABO system consists of A and B antigens and antibodies against these antigens. There are 4 major groups in the ABO system (A, B, AB, and O) that result from 3 major alleles (A, B, and O) of the ABO gene ({110300}). Additional ABO subgroups are produced by dozens of ABO subgroup alleles. The A and B antigens are carbohydrate rather than protein antigens and are synthesized by a series of reactions catalyzed by glycosyltransferases. The final step in their biosynthesis is catalyzed by the A and B glycosyltransferases, which are encoded by the A and B alleles of the ABO gene, respectively. Individuals with blood group O do not produce functional A or B glycosyltransferases and therefore lack A and B antigens. Unlike many other blood group systems, the presence of naturally occurring antibodies against A and B antigens in individuals who do not express those antigens causes an adverse and potentially fatal outcome at the first mismatched transfusion. Because the A and B antigens exist in cells other than red blood cells, ABO matching is also important in cell, tissue, and organ transplantation, and ABO blood groups are important in forensic science (review by {19:Yamamoto, 2004}).",,0.38,,"['Blood group, ABO system', 'ABO']","[('""1427899""', 'abo'), ('""1639411""', 'abo')]",0.41,0.4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

{2:Baumgartner et al. (2001)} reported the sporadic case of a 16-year-old boy with this rare autosomal disorder. They emphasized that many pathologic fractures, lumps on the head, elevated serum alkaline phosphatase levels, and dental caries are the main characteristics of the disorder. Their patient had had 10 pathologic fractures between age 6 weeks and 15 years. An elevated serum alkaline phosphatase was found at age 11 and skull lumps at age 15.

Lumbar spine BMD Z-score was -1.9 at age 11, and x-rays showed a compression fracture at T12 and sclerotic lesions in the skull. Plasma alkaline phosphatase was elevated, consistent with increased bone turnover. Transiliac bone biopsy revealed thin and structurally abnormal cortical bone and thin trabeculae, and osteoclast activity was increased. Her father sustained multiple fractures beginning at age 4 years, involving the skull, clavicle, radius, ulna, metacarpal and carpal bones, tibia, and fibula. He also experienced peripheral facial nerve palsies, and transient episodes of oculomotor and trochlear nerve paresis beginning in the fifth decade of life. MRI and CT showed no narrowing of the bony cranial nerve canals. Skull x-rays revealed CDL. The proband's 85-year-old paternal grandmother had severe osteoporosis and had sustained at least 14 nonvertebral fractures as well as multiple vertebral compression fractures. Skull x-rays showed irregular diffuse thickening but no clear doughnut lesions. She also experienced transient peripheral facial nerve beginning in the sixth decade of life, and abducens nerve palsies at age 82 years. The proband was diagnosed with glaucoma at age 3 years and had secondary uveitis and cataracts, and the grandmother was diagnosed with chronic congestive glaucoma at age 58, but the father had normal intraocular pressures. The authors concluded that CDL with osteoporosis segregated in this family with dominant inheritance and high penetrance, although they noted that the severity of the condition varied between family members.

{6:Pekkinen et al. (2019)} described 10 patients from 4 unrelated families with CDL (families 1 to 4), including the Finnish family reported by {4:Jaakkola et al. (2009)}, who exhibited low bone mineral density combined with multiple childhood-onset peripheral and/or vertebral fractures, often but not always associated with the mild cranial sclerotic lesions characteristic of CDL. Several patients experienced recurrent peripheral facial nerve palsy or other neurologic manifestations. {6:Pekkinen et al. (2019)} reviewed transiliac bone biopsies from 2 unrelated Finnish patients (families 1 and 2), which showed reduced mineral content, increased heterogeneity in matrix mineralization, and a highly increased proportion of low-mineralized bone compared to controls.

95,95,12079,tas2r38,OMIM:171200,Phenylthiocarbamide tasting,"['TAS2R38', ' T2R61', ' PTC', ' THIOT']","The sense of bitter taste is mediated by a group of bitter taste receptor proteins that reside on the surface of taste cells within the taste buds of the tongue. These proteins are 7-transmembrane domain, G protein-coupled receptors that are encoded by the TAS2R gene family (see TAS2R10; {604791}), which contains at least 25 functional genes ({22:Kim et al., 2005}).

Humans worldwide display a bimodality in sensitivity to the bitter taste of PTC, with approximately 75% of individuals perceiving it as intensely bitter, whereas the rest perceive it as tasteless. This difference has been the basis of study of taste perception in humans for over 70 years. {21:Kim and Drayna (2004)} provided an historical review of the subject.

Propylthiouracil (PROP) and PTC are members of a class of compounds known as thioureas. The compounds carry the chemical group N-C=S, which is responsible for their characteristic bitter taste ({3:Bartoshuk et al., 1994}; {10:Drewnowski and Rock, 1995}).","Variation in the ability to taste PTC was discovered by {12:Fox (1931)}. Supplementation of the standard test using quinine in the intermediate cases was suggested by {16:Kalmus (1958)}. There has been a suggestion that PTC tasting in man is related to a component of saliva: {5:Cohen and Ogdon (1949)} claimed that PTC tasters can taste PTC only if it is dissolved in their own saliva. If the tongue is dried and then presented with PTC dissolved in someone else's saliva, it is tasteless. {15:Jones and McLachlan (1991)} described a technique for fitting mixture distributions to data on PTC sensitivity.

It has long been proposed that there is a relationship between athyreotic hypothyroidism ({218700}; formerly called athyreotic cretinism) and PTC nontasting (e.g., {32:Shepard, 1961}). Both PTC and PROP are structurally similar to the naturally occurring antithyroid substance l-goitrin; all members of this class of chemicals have antithyroidal activity and are not tasted by PTC nontasters ({32:Shepard, 1961}). Nearly all individuals with athyreotic hypothyroidism are nontasters.

{35:Tepper (1998)} reviewed the literature for the ability to taste PTC and PROP and the implications for food preference and dietary habits. {35:Tepper (1998)} discussed the classic explanation for the persistence of the PROP polymorphism, i.e., a selective advantage for avoidance of harmful compounds in the environment that are often bitter tasting ({10:Drewnowski and Rock, 1995}). This taste aversion may have special relevance for the avoidance of certain bitter-tasting vegetables. PROP and PTC are chemically related to the isothiocyanates and goitrin, bitter-tasting compounds that are present in cruciferous vegetables such as cabbage, broccoli, brussels sprouts, turnips, and kale. When eaten in large quantities, these compounds interfere with iodine metabolism, producing thyroid enlargement and goiterlike symptoms. {35:Tepper (1998)} noted that the incidence of thyroid deficiency disease is relatively rare among PTC tasters. In modern society, however, avoidance of bitter-tasting foods may have health disadvantages, since epidemiologic studies indicate that diets low in fruits and vegetables and high in fat may be associated with increased risk of heart disease and cancer.

118,118,15717,aldh2,OMIM:610251,"Alcohol sensitivity, acute",['ALDH2'],,"{15:Wolff (1972)} demonstrated that East Asians, after drinking amounts of alcohol that have no detectable effect on Caucasians, respond with marked facial flushing and mild to moderate symptoms of intoxication. {15:Wolff (1972)} believed that group differences were attributable to differences in autonomic reactivity.

{13:Stamatoyannopoulos et al. (1975)} suggested that the racial difference in alcohol intoxication is due to rapid acetaldehyde formation as a result of the highly active atypical alcohol dehydrogenase isozyme found in high frequency in East Asians.

{5:Goedde et al. (1979)} proposed that the high frequency of acute alcoholic intoxication in East Asians is related to the high frequency of persons with absence of ALDH2 liver isozyme. Individuals lacking the enzyme suffer the alcohol-flush reaction when they drink alcoholic beverages. {5:Goedde et al. (1979)} suggested that the reaction is the result of excessive acetaldehyde accumulation, and the unpleasant symptoms tend to reduce alcohol consumption. The lower incidence of alcoholism in certain East Asian groups may have its basis in these observations.

Almost all Caucasians have 2 major ALDH isozymes in the liver: cytosolic ALDH1 ({100640}) and mitochondrial ALDH2. {7:Harada et al. (1980)} presented evidence that aldehyde dehydrogenase is polymorphic in Japanese. As in previous studies in Europeans, they found 2 isozymes of ALDH in liver specimens of Japanese, but unlike the study of specimens of Europeans, they found that 52% of Japanese specimens showed absence of ALDH2. The authors suggested that the intoxicating symptoms after alcohol drinking in many Japanese may be due to delayed oxidation of acetaldehyde. The lack of ALDH2 is apparently responsible for the higher blood acetaldehyde levels in East Asians, leading to facial flushing and other vasomotor symptoms after alcohol intake.

{1:Agarwal et al. (1981)} performed a population genetic study in Asians of several different extractions. They investigated ALDH isozymes in hair root lysates with a sensitive isoelectric focusing method. Between 40 and 80% of the several Asian groups were found to be deficient in ALDH2, whereas not a single European individual was deficient. Deficiency was invariably associated with sensitivity to alcohol. Family studies suggested autosomal recessive inheritance of the deficiency. {6:Harada et al. (1981)} found the deficiency in 43% of Japanese; all deficient persons had flushing symptoms and, after alcohol drinking, showed a mean concentration of acetaldehyde of 37.3 micromoles as compared with 2.1 micromoles in nondeficient persons.

{8:Impraim et al. (1982)} found that the livers of persons lacking the ALDH2 isozyme show an enzymatically inactive but immunologically cross-reactive material (CRM) corresponding to the ALDH2 isozyme.

{4:Goedde et al. (1983)} showed that the frequency of absent ALDH2 varied from 69% in Indians of the Ecuador Highlands to 44% in Japanese and 35% in Chinese to 0% in Egyptians, Liberians, Kenyans, and Europeans. They suggested that deficiency is related to flushing and a slower metabolism of acetaldehyde, and in turn a lower frequency of alcoholism and alcohol-related problems.

The ALDH2 alleles encoding the active and inactive subunits are termed 'ALDH2*1' and 'ALDH2*2,' respectively; see {100650.0001}. It had been thought that the 2 alleles were expressed codominantly, and that only individuals homozygous for ALDH2*2 were ALDH2-deficient. However, studies of the inheritance of alcohol-induced flushing in families suggested that the trait is dominant ({11:Schwitters et al., 1982}).

{12:Shibuya et al. (1988)} studied 23 Japanese with alcoholic liver disease. No difference was found in the genotypes at the ADH2 ({103720}) locus; however, at the ALDH2 locus, 20 of the 23 patients were homozygous for ALDH2*1, only 3 were heterozygous, and none of the patients was homozygous for ALDH2*2. The results were interpreted as indicating that Japanese with the atypical allele are at a much lower risk for alcoholic liver disease, presumably due to their sensitivity to alcohol intoxication.

In a study of 140 men and women of Chinese, Japanese, and Korean heritage, {14:Wall et al. (2000)} found that those with ALDH2*2 alleles experienced more severe hangovers and suggested that this may contribute, in part, to protection against the development of excessive or problematic drinking in Asian Americans. {18:Yokoyama et al. (2005)} found that inactive heterozygous ALDH2, alcohol flushing, and increased mean corpuscular volume (MCV) were positively associated with hangover susceptibility in Japanese workers, suggesting that acetaldehyde is etiologically linked to the development of hangover.

{19:Yoshida et al. (1989)} demonstrated that among Caucasians alcohol flushing can be related to abnormalities of ALDH1. In 9 unrelated Caucasian alcohol flushers, they found 1 who exhibited low activity (10-20% of normal) and another who exhibited moderately low activity (60%) and altered kinetic properties. The electrophoretic mobilities of these 2 samples were not altered. Immunologic quantitation indicated that the amount of protein in the 2 samples was not reduced in parallel with the enzyme deficiency. In the first case, the daughter of the proposita also had very low enzyme activity and alcohol flushing.",,0.49,"['Alcohol sensitivity, acute', 'ALDH2']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The defect causes decreased levels of the coenzymes adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl) and methylcobalamin (MeCbl), which results in decreased activity of the respective enzymes methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MUT; {609058}) and methyltetrahydrofolate:homocysteine methyltransferase, also known as methionine synthase (MTR; {156570}). Different forms of the disorder have been classified according to complementation groups of cells in vitro: cblC, cblD ({277410}), cblF ({277380}), and cblJ ({614857}).

Isolated methylmalonic acidurias have also been classified by complementation groups: MMA 'mut' ({251000}) is caused by mutation in the MUT gene on chromosome 6p21; MMA cblA ({251100}) is caused by mutation in the MMAA gene ({607481}) on 4q31; and MMA cblB ({251110}) is caused by mutation in the MMAB gene ({607568}) on 12q24.

Methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria of cblC type is the most common inborn error of vitamin B12 (cobalamin) metabolism, with about 250 known cases ({22:Lerner-Ellis et al., 2006}). Affected individuals may have developmental, hematologic, neurologic, metabolic, ophthalmologic, and dermatologic clinical findings. Although considered a disease of infancy or childhood, some individuals develop symptoms in adulthood ({33:Rosenblatt et al., 1997}).","{30:Mudd et al. (1969)} reported an infant with homocysteinemia, methylmalonic aciduria, cystathioninemia, and a decrease in blood methionine. He died at 7.5 weeks of age. In vitro analysis identified a defect in the 2 reactions in which vitamin B12 derivatives function as coenzymes: methionine formation from 5-methylfolate-H(4) (MTR) and homocysteine, and isomerization of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA (MUT). Since vitamin B12 was present in normal concentrations in the liver, {30:Mudd et al. (1969)} concluded that the gene-determined defect involved the conversion of B12 to the active coenzymes. {26:McCully (1969)} studied the same patient as that reported by {31:Mudd et al. (1970)} and noted arterial changes and atherosclerosis on pathologic examination.

The patient described by {13:Dillon et al. (1974)} differed from the others in that in addition to severe mental retardation and megaloblastosis, clinical and pathologic changes typical of subacute degeneration of the spinal cord were present. {5:Baumgartner et al. (1979)} reported a male infant who died at 4 months of age after 2 episodes of acute heart failure. He had hemolytic and megaloblastic anemia, hematuria, proteinuria, and mild uremia. Plasma and urine levels of methionine were low, whereas levels of cystathionine were increased. Vitamin B12 deficiency, malabsorption, and transport defect were excluded by normal serum cobalamin and transcobalamins. Autopsy showed severe vascular lesions with changes of thrombotic thrombocytopenia in the kidney, suggesting the hemolytic-uremic syndrome. Elevated plasma homocysteine was presumed to be responsible for the vascular lesions. Analysis of postmortem liver showed deficiency of both cobalamin-dependent enzymes.

{10:Brandstetter et al. (1990)} reported a 16-week-old infant with cblC who died from cor pulmonale due to thromboemboli in the pulmonary circulation. They suggested that the pathogenesis was the same as that of thromboembolic disease in homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency ({236200}). {10:Brandstetter et al. (1990)} emphasized the frequent finding of pigmentary retinopathy and abnormality in the macular area of the ocular fundus. {34:Russo et al. (1992)} described 3 infants with cblC disease characterized by metabolic acidosis, methylmalonic aciduria, and homocystinuria. In the first weeks of life, all showed failure to thrive, hypotonia, and lethargy associated with pancytopenia and hepatic dysfunction, which progressed to severe respiratory insufficiency and renal failure consistent with hemolytic-uremic syndrome. The infants died at 40, 45, and 75 days of age. Postmortem findings were dominated by thrombotic microangiopathy of the kidneys and lungs, diffuse hepatic steatosis, and megaloblastic changes in the bone marrow. Severe gastritis with striking cystic dysplastic mucosal changes and total absence of parietal and chief cells was found in all 3 patients, with the rest of the gastrointestinal tract being essentially normal.

{33:Rosenblatt et al. (1997)} reviewed 50 cblC patients who could be classified into 2 broad phenotypes: 44 had early onset and 6 had later onset. The 44 patients presented in the first year of life with feeding difficulties, hypotonia, developmental delay, seizures, pigmentary retinopathy, and anemia. About one-fourth of the patients died, and those who survived had neurologic impairment.

{11:Cerone et al. (1999)} described mild facial anomalies in combined methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria of the cblC form. Features included a long face, high forehead, large, floppy, and low-set ears, and flat philtrum. The morphologic characteristics became more evident after 3 years of age, and were noted separately by physicians of 2 different departments. A female patient showed high forehead and low-set ears when first observed at the age of 2 months.

{2:Andersson et al. (1999)} described the clinical and biochemical features of 8 cblC patients who were treated for an average of 5.7 years. Treatment consisted of daily oral carnitine and intramuscular hydroxocobalamin. The patients had congenital malformations including microcephaly at birth (2 of 8), congenital heart disease (2 of 8), dysmorphic facial features (1 of 8), and thyroglossal duct cyst (1 of 8). Postnatal hydrocephalus (2 of 8) and hip dislocation caused by ligament laxity (1 of 8) were also noted. One patient had profound visual impairment before 6 months of age secondary to cblC retinopathy, and 2 patients had abnormal retinal pigmentation with normal visual function. All patients presented with poor growth, feeding problems, and/or seizures.

{38:Van Hove et al. (2002)} described a 12-year-old boy and his 4-year-old sister who presented with proteinuria, hematuria, hypertension, and chronic hemolytic anemia. Renal biopsy showed a chronic thrombotic microangiopathic nephropathy. Hyperhomocysteinemia and mild methylmalonic aciduria were also found. Fibroblast studies were compatible with a mild cblC complementation group. The children had no neurologic symptoms and minimal pigmentary retinal abnormalities. Both children and their father carried a balanced reciprocal translocation, t(8;19)(q23.2;q13.3). Treatment with higher than usual doses of parenteral hydroxycobalamin and oral betaine stopped the thrombotic microangiopathy.

{35:Schimel and Mets (2006)} reported the ocular findings in 3 patients with cblC disease. All 3 presented with macular pigmentary changes and showed attenuation of electroretinographic (ERG) responses. Based on the findings in these patients and a literature review, {35:Schimel and Mets (2006)} concluded that cblC disease results in progressive retinal degeneration beginning in the first few months of life and progressing rapidly over the first few years of life.

{20:Komhoff et al. (2013)} studied 4 patients with combined pulmonary arterial hypertension and renal thrombotic microangiopathy, who were identified from the Dutch national referral center for pediatric pulmonary hypertension. A fifth patient with this combination was contacted to collect clinical data. All 5 had cobalamin C (cblC) deficiency, diagnosed postmortem in 2 patients. Onset of disease ranged from 1.5 to 14 years of age. The 2 youngest patients presented with concomitant pulmonary and renal disease; in the older patients, pulmonary arterial hypertension was preceded by renal thrombotic microangiopathy from age 2.5 to 7 years. Three patients presenting at 3 years of age or younger died of right ventricular failure secondary to progressive pulmonary arterial hypertension. Three patients were treated with hydroxocobalamin; 1 died 2 weeks after diagnosis, 1 exhibited progressive pulmonary vasculopathy, and 1 patient was in stable condition at the time of the study. cblC deficiency was diagnosed biochemically 2 days to 18 years after initial presentation. {20:Komhoff et al. (2013)} identified cblC deficiency as the cause of the rare combination of pulmonary arterial hypertension and renal thrombotic microangiopathy in these patients. The authors proposed that early recognition of cblC deficiency and vigorous treatment with hydroxocobalamin may ameliorate the devastating course of this condition.

{1:Ahrens-Nicklas et al. (2017)} completed a retrospective analysis of 12 patients with cblC referred for abnormal newborn screening results and followed at the Children's Hospital of Pennsylvania between 1999 and 2015. Of the patients, 87.5% had intellectual disability and 75% had retinopathy; 16.7% had 1 episode of mild acidosis. However, no patients manifested major metabolic decompensation. Developmental outcomes correlated more closely with initial metabolic abnormalities than with long-term metabolic control. Increased intake of medical foods resulted in better control but also perturbations in the ratios of essential amino acids and lower z-scores for head circumference. {1:Ahrens-Nicklas et al. (2017)} found no relationship between diet and cognitive outcomes.

{19:He et al. (2020)} reported 70 Chinese patients with early-onset MAHCC and hydrocephalus. In the 68 cases with available clinical information, the median age of diagnosis of hydrocephalus was 3 months (range, 0.3-96 months). The hydrocephalus presented before metabolic treatment in 60 cases and after metabolic treatment in 8 cases. Signs of intracranial hypertension were uncommon and included vomiting in 7 cases, 'sunset eyes' in 7 cases, and enlarged head circumference in 6 cases. Brain imaging by CT and/or MRI showed bilateral ventricular dilatation and cortical atrophy in all 70 patients and subdural collections in 13 cases. A ventriculoperitoneal shunt was performed in 36 cases for indications including progressive aggravation of intracranial hypertension and moderate to severe bilateral ventriculomegaly. In 30 patients, the hydrocephalus improved after metabolic treatment only. Other clinical manifestations in the patients included psychomotor retardation in 68, visual impairments in 68, seizures in 42, anemia in 27, and lethargy/coma in 17.

{25:Matmat et al. (2022)} provided a systematic review of ocular manifestations in patients with inborn errors of intracellular cobalamin metabolism from a literature review of 52 studies reporting 163 cbl and 24 mut patients. Ocular manifestations were identified in all cbl defects except for cblB and cblD-MMA; cblC was the most frequent disorder, affecting 137 patients (84%).

<Subhead> Late-Onset cblC Disease

{15:Goodman et al. (1970)} reported 2 brothers with a milder, possibly allelic form of the disorder. The elder, a 14-year-old Mexican American, was first admitted to the hospital in an acute psychotic episode. He had an IQ of about 50, a somewhat marfanoid habitus, and mild abnormalities on neurologic examination. Ectopia lentis and chest deformity were lacking. The parents were first cousins once removed.

{36:Shinnar and Singer (1984)} described a clinically atypical patient with the cblC defect. An adolescent girl had been a straight-A student and in excellent health until age 12. Over the period of a year, her grades deteriorated markedly and her work became equivalent to that of a first-grader. She developed apathy, unsteady gait, and impaired speech. Examination showed broad-based gait, impaired vibration and position sense, and extensor Babinski response. IQ was 40 to 50. Hemoglobin was 12.6 gm%, mean corpuscular volume 96, serum B12 level normal, and red cell folate level 88 ng per ml red cells (mildly decreased). Blood showed elevated homocysteine and only a trace of methionine. The urine contained large amounts of homocysteine and methylmalonic acid. On parenteral hydroxycobalamin (1,000 micrograms per day), the patient improved markedly. A 12-year-old sister and an 8-week-old brother were found to have the same cblC defect, confirmed by fibroblast studies.

{33:Rosenblatt et al. (1997)} found that 6 of 50 cblC patients had later onset, after age 4 years. These patients presented with acute neurologic dysfunction, including cognitive decline, confusion, psychosis, dementia, and extrapyramidal signs. Later-onset patients had better survival, better response to treatment, and less neurologic sequelae compared to the early-onset patients.

{8:Bodamer et al. (2001)} reported what they believed to be the first case of adult-onset cblC. The patient was a 20-year-old man who presented with slowly progressive leg weakness, loss of bowel and bladder function, episodes of forgetfulness, slurred speech, and deep venous thromboses. He later became unresponsive and required mechanical ventilation. A diagnosis of cobalamin defect was suggested after he was determined to have elevated plasma homocysteine and methylmalonic aciduria. Treatment with hydroxycobalamin and carnitine proved effective. The authors suggested that the patient may have had a mild mutation resulting in significant residual enzyme activity.

{7:Ben-Omran et al. (2007)} reported 2 unrelated patients with late-onset cblC disease. The first patient was a 14-year old girl, born of first-cousin Pakistani parents, who developed progressive neurologic decline, including dementia, depression, ataxia, lethargy, incontinence, and seizures over a period of 2 years. After visits to several physicians without a correct diagnosis, analysis of plasma and urine showed increased homocysteine and methylmalonate consistent with a defect in cobalamin synthesis. Appropriate treatment resulted in clinical improvement with residual mild gait ataxia. The second patient was a 10-year-old girl of Bengali descent who presented with acute dementia, anorexia, extreme weight loss, and 'catatonic psychotic behavior.' She had a mild learning disability with an IQ of 72 and seizures. Brain MRI performed at ages 4 and 10 years showed progressive volume loss. Laboratory analysis detected cblC disease, and appropriate treatment resulted in clinical improvement. Both patients were found to be homozygous for the R132X mutation in the MMACHC gene ({609831.0003}). {7:Ben-Omran et al. (2007)} noted the diagnostic difficulty in late-onset cblC disease and emphasized the utility of plasma and urine analysis, as patients may have normal red blood cell indices.

{37:Tsai et al. (2007)} described a 36-year-old woman with a spinal cord infarct who was subsequently diagnosed with methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria, cblC type. Her past medical history was significant for joint hypermobility, arthritis, bilateral cataracts, unilateral hearing loss, chronic anemia, and frequent urinary tract infections secondary to a urogenital fistula. She reported emotional difficulties beginning in her teens and was diagnosed with depression and psychosis requiring hospitalization in her thirties. One to 2 years prior to the spinal cord infarct, the patient experienced increasing muscular weakness, leg paresthesias, and difficulty walking. The woman sought help in the emergency department for her weakness and paresthesia but was misdiagnosed with malingering because of her psychiatric history. One week later, she experienced lower extremity hemiplegia, and bladder incontinence and diagnosed with a spinal cord infarct. Laboratory evaluation revealed elevated homocysteine and methylmalonic acid consistent with cblC disease. Molecular analysis of the MMACHC gene revealed the 271dupA ({609831.0001}) and R161Q ({609831.0005}) mutations. {37:Tsai et al. (2007)} recommended that all patients with psychiatric disease complicated by dementia and myelopathy be screened with plasma amino acids and urine organic acids allowing cblC disease to be preliminarily diagnosed or effectively excluded.

{12:Collison et al. (2015)} reported a 28-year-old woman who presented with decreased central vision and mild photoaversion for 2 years. She had a past medical history of iron deficiency anemia and kidney and urinary tract infections. Visual field testing demonstrated a bilateral pericentral scotoma, and funduscopy showed bilateral bull's eye-appearing macular lesions. Repeat ophthalmologic evaluation at age 35 years showed the bull's eye-appearing macular dystrophy with extension of retinal peripheral atrophy. Laboratory testing showed elevated urine methylmalonic acid and homocysteine.

{9:Bonafede et al. (2015)} reported retinal abnormalities in 11 patients, aged 4 months to 15 years, with cblC. The patients with early-onset cblC demonstrated rapidly progressive maculopathy with severe loss of outer nuclear and ganglion cell layers, generally before 1 year of age. The 4 patients with later-onset cblC disease (older than 7 years of age) had a retina-wide degeneration, suggesting a different rate of disease progression in the extramacular retina in these patients. Other ophthalmologic findings included pseudocolobomas in 3 patients and nystagmus in 8 patients. Of the 6 patients who had electroretinograms, 5 were normal and 1 showed reduced rod-mediated responses. The most common refractive error was myopia. {9:Bonafede et al.

150,150,21208,cyp3a5,OMIM:145500,"Hypertension, essential","['PTGIS', ' CYP8A1', ' PGIS', ' CYP8']","The Pickering school held that blood pressure has a continuous distribution, that multiple genes and multiple environmental factors determine the level of one's blood pressure just as the determination of stature and intelligence is multifactorial, and that 'essential hypertension' is merely the upper end of the distribution ({66:Pickering, 1978}). In this view the person with essential hypertension is one who happens to inherit an aggregate of genes determining hypertension (and also is exposed to exogenous factors that favor hypertension). The Platt school took the view that essential hypertension is a simple mendelian dominant trait ({69:Platt, 1963}). {57:McDonough et al. (1964)} defended the monogenic idea. See {58:McKusick (1960)} and {52:Kurtz and Spence (1993)} for reviews. {78:Swales (1985)} reviewed the Platt-Pickering controversy as an 'episode in recent medical history.' The Pickering point of view appears to be more consistent with the observations.","{71:Ravogli et al. (1990)} measured blood pressure in 15 normotensive subjects whose parents were both hypertensive (FH+/+), 15 normotensive subjects with 1 hypertensive parent (FH +/-), and 15 normotensive subjects whose parents were not hypertensive (FH -/-); among the 3 groups, subjects were matched for age, sex, and body mass index. The measurements were made in the office during a variety of laboratory stressors and during a prolonged rest period, and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was done for a 24-hour period. Office blood pressure was higher in the FH +/+ group than in the FH -/- group. The pressor responses were similar in the 2 groups, but the FH +/+ group had higher prolonged 24-hour blood pressure than the FH -/- group; the differences were always significant at the 5% level for systolic blood pressure. The FH +/+ group also had a greater left ventricular mass index by echocardiography than the FH -/- group. The blood pressure values and echocardiographic values of the FH +/- group tended to lie between those of the other 2 groups. Thus, the higher blood pressure shown by individuals in the prehypertensive stage with a family history of parental hypertension does not reflect a hyperreactivity to stress but an early permanent blood pressure elevation. See comments by {67:Pickering (1990)}, the son of the early defender of the multifactorial hypothesis.

In a comparison of normotensive subjects who had either hypertensive or normotensive parents, {81:van Hooft et al. (1991)} found that the mean renal blood flow was lower in subjects with 2 hypertensive parents than in those with 2 normotensive parents. Moreover, both the filtration fraction and renal vascular resistance were higher in the subjects with 2 hypertensive parents. The subjects with 2 hypertensive parents had lower plasma concentrations of renin ({179820}) and aldosterone than those with 2 normotensive parents. The values in subjects with one hypertensive and one normotensive parent fell between those for the other 2 groups. The conclusion of {81:van Hooft et al. (1991)} was that alterations in renal hemodynamics occur at an early stage in the development of familial hypertension.

Examination of the biochemical processes that effect blood pressure homeostasis should elucidate some of the interactive physiologic regulators that malfunction in persons with elevated pressure and show whether single genes of large effect are important in some. For example, the electrochemical gradients of cations across erythrocyte membranes are maintained by at least 7 pathways. {30:Garay and Meyer (1979)} demonstrated an abnormally low ratio of Na+ to K+ net fluxes in sodium-loading and potassium-depleted erythrocytes of human essential hypertension. This finding was absent in normotensive families and in secondary hypertension, but present in some young normotensive children of hypertensive parents.

{28:Garay et al. (1980)} found that erythrocytes have a Na, K-cotransport system (independent of the pump) that extrudes both internal Na and K and is functionally deficient in red cells of persons with essential hypertension and some of their descendants, with or without hypertension. {62:Parfrey et al. (1981)} showed that whereas young adults with a familial predisposition to hypertension behave similarly to those without such a predisposition in having a pressor response to a high sodium intake, they are peculiar in showing a depressor response to a high potassium intake. {32:Garay (1981)} found a defect in the furosemide-sensitive Na-K cotransfer mechanism in red cells of patients with essential hypertension and in some of their normotensive relatives. The same defect is found in strains of experimental animals bred for susceptibility to salt-induced hypertension or spontaneous hypertension.

{24:Etkin et al. (1982)} assessed red cell sodium transport simply by measuring the unidirectional passive influx of sodium-22 into ouabain-treated erythrocytes. In American blacks with essential hypertension, this approach failed to show the abnormal erythrocyte sodium transport that is characteristic of white persons with essential hypertension. Thus, among American blacks, essential hypertension may have a different genetic basis. {17:De Wardener and MacGregor (1982)} reviewed evidence for the hypothesis that 'the underlying genetic lesion is a renal difficulty in excreting sodium,' which sets in train a rise in the circulating concentration of a sodium-transport inhibitor.

{8:Canessa et al. (1980)} found ouabain-insensitive erythrocyte sodium-lithium countertransport (SLC) to be at least 2-fold elevated in patients. {87:Woods et al. (1982)} confirmed these results and further showed that normotensive sons of patients had significantly higher rates of countertransport than sons of normotensive controls. In patients with a positive family history, {14:Clegg et al. (1982)} found raised lithium efflux in 76% and raised red cell sodium content in 36%. {42:Heagerty et al. (1982)} measured sodium efflux rates in leukocytes in 18 normotensive subjects who had one or more first-degree relatives with essential hypertension. The total efflux rate constant was significantly lower, owing to reduced ouabain-sensitive sodium pump activity.

{88:Woods et al. (1983)} demonstrated that the rate of sodium-lithium countertransport may not be a wholly intrinsic feature of the red cell; a dialyzable plasma factor could be demonstrated. In a study of white males, {86:Weder (1986)} found that lithium clearance, a measure of proximal tubular reabsorption of sodium, was reduced and red-cell lithium-sodium countertransport was increased in hypertensives as compared with normals. Within the group of normotensive controls, lithium clearance was lower in those with at least 1 first-degree relative with hypertension than in those with no hypertensive relative. {86:Weder (1986)} concluded that enhanced proximal tubular sodium reabsorption may precede the development of essential hypertension.

{48:Kagamimori et al. (1985)} found a significant correlation in lithium-sodium countertransport and sodium-potassium cotransport rates in red blood cells in parent-offspring pairs (r = 0.52, p less than 0.01, and r = 0.46, p less than 0.01, respectively) but not in husband-wife pairs. Sodium pump rates, on the other hand, were significantly correlated in both pairs. This led them to conclude that sodium pump has a substantial environmental component whereas the genetic component predominates in the other functions. This conclusion was supported by the fact that sodium pump rates correlated significantly with sodium/creatinine and sodium/potassium ratios in casual urine. {40:Hasstedt et al. (1988)} presented evidence supporting the possibility that an allele at a major locus elevates the rate of sodium-lithium countertransport. {72:Rebbeck et al. (1991)} found evidence of both environmental and genetic factors in the determination of sodium-lithium countertransport.

{64:Parmer et al. (1992)} assessed baroreflex sensitivity in hypertensives with or without a positive family history of hypertension and in normotensives with or without a positive family history. This was done by recording cardiac slowing in response to acute phenylephrine-induced hypertension and cardiac acceleration in response to amyl nitrite-induced fall in blood pressure. Of all variables investigated, family history of hypertension was the strongest unique predictor of baroreflex sensitivity. {64:Parmer et al. (1992)} suggested that impairment in baroreflex sensitivity in hypertension is in part genetically determined and may be an important hereditary component in the pathogenesis of essential hypertension.

Low birth weight is associated with the subsequent development of hypertension in adult life. Maternal malnutrition has been suggested as the cause. {23:Edwards et al. (1993)} suggested an alternative etiology, namely, increased fetal exposure to maternal glucocorticoids. {5:Benediktsson et al. (1993)} pointed out that hypertension is strongly predicted by the combination of low birth weight and a large placenta. Normally, fetal protection is afforded by placental 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase ({218030}), which converts physiologic glucocorticoids to inactive products.

{76:Siffert et al. (1995)} and {68:Pietruck et al. (1996)} demonstrated an enhanced signal transduction via pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins in lymphoblasts and fibroblasts from selected patients with essential hypertension.

{61:Noon et al. (1997)} studied 105 men, aged 23 to 33 years, drawn at random from the population studied by {59:Medical Research Council Working Party (1985)}. In hypertensive subjects with hypertensive parents, {61:Noon et al. (1997)} reported impaired dermal vasodilatation and fewer capillaries on the dorsum of the finger, as compared to these factors in hypertensive subjects with hypotensive parents or hypotensive subjects with either hypo- or hypertensive parents. No differences in other hemodynamic indices were seen among the groups. {61:Noon et al. (1997)} suggested that defective angiogenesis may be an etiological component in the inheritance of hypertension.

<Subhead> Salt-Sensitive Essential Hypertension

Several varieties of familial, salt-sensitive, low-renin hypertension with a proven or presumptive genetic basis have been described ({36:Gordon, 1995}). The conditions in which the molecular basis of the disorder has been identified at the DNA level include 2 forms of Liddle syndrome ({177200}) due to mutation in the beta subunit ({600760.0001}) or gamma subunit ({600761.0001}) of the amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channel; the syndrome of apparent mineralocorticoid excess (AME) due to a defect in the renal form of 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase ({218030}); and the form of familial hyperaldosteronism which is successfully treated with low doses of glucocorticoids, such as dexamethasone ('glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism'), which is due to a Lapore hemoglobin-like fusion of the contiguous CYP11B1 ({610613}) and CYP11B2 ({124080}) genes.

In studies in rats, {56:Machnik et al. (2009)} demonstrated that TONEBP ({604708})-VEGFC ({601528}) signaling in mononuclear phagocytes is a major determinant of extracellular volume and blood pressure homeostasis, and that VEGFC is an osmosensitive, hypertonicity-driven gene intimately involved in salt-induced hypertension.

<Subhead> Syndromic Forms of Hypo- and Hypertension

{55:Lifton (1996)} reviewed the molecular genetics of human blood pressure variation. He pointed out that at least 10 genes have been shown to alter blood pressure; most of these are rare mutations imparting large quantitative effects that either raise or lower blood pressure. These mutations alter blood pressure through a common pathway, changing salt and water reabsorption in the kidney. Disorders that fall into this category include glucocorticoid remediable aldosteronism ({103900}), the syndrome of apparent mineralocorticoid excess ({218030}), and Liddle syndrome ({177200}), which is known to be caused by a mutation in either the beta subunit or the gamma subunit of the renal epithelial sodium channel. Unlike the preceding conditions, hypotension characterizes the following mendelian disorders: pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 ({264350}), which can be produced by mutation in either the alpha subunit ({600228}) or the beta subunit ({600760}) of the same epithelial sodium channel involved in Liddle syndrome; and Gitelman syndrome ({263800}), which is caused by mutations in the thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl cotransporter ({600968}).

{53:Lifton et al. (2001)} reviewed rare syndromic forms of hyper- and hypotension showing mendelian inheritance, for some of which the underlying mutations have been identified by positional cloning and candidate gene analyses. These genes all regulate renal salt reabsorption, in accordance with the work of {38:Guyton (1991)} and others that established that the kidney plays a central role in blood pressure regulation.",0.5,0.46,"['Hypertension, essential', 'PTGIS', ' CYP8A1', ' PGIS', ' CYP8']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The dose requirement is highly variable, both interindividually and interethnically ({27:Yuan et al., 2005}).

Variation in the VKORC1 gene is believed to be the most important individual predictor of warfarin dose, accounting for about 30% of the variance observed in dosing ({17:Ross et al., 2010}).","{14:O'Reilly et al. (1964)} described resistance to the hypoprothrombinemic effects of coumarin drugs in 7 persons in 3 generations of a family with no male-to-male transmission. They postulated that an autosomal gene is responsible for the synthesis of a clotting factor dependent on vitamin K and that in this family affected persons have an abnormal factor with decreased affinity for the coumarin drug or increased affinity for vitamin K. {15:O'Reilly (1970)} described a second kindred of which 18 members were shown to have relative resistance to oral anticoagulant drugs. Several instances of male-to-male transmission were observed. Of the various possible mechanisms for the relative resistance, all could be excluded except mutation in the vitamin K-anticoagulant receptor site. Positive evidence favoring the latter included the correction of hypoprothrombinemia by small amounts of exogenous vitamin K and the fact that the anticoagulant dose-response curves for the probands of the 2 families studied by O'Reilly and normal subjects are parallel. {16:Pool et al. (1968)} concluded that the resistance to warfarin is due to a decreased affinity of the receptor sites in the liver to coumarin anticoagulant drugs. This mendelian variation must be distinguished from the polygenic variation in coumarin responsiveness due to variations in metabolism of the drug.

{8:Lewis et al. (1967)} reported a single patient with warfarin resistance resulting from abnormally rapid clearance of the drug. Resistance to phenindione, a drug of different structure, was also demonstrated.

{1:Alving et al. (1985)} reported a black family in which the proposita and her daughter had relative resistance to the anticoagulant effects of warfarin. A diet deficient in vitamin K was accompanied by enhanced effects of warfarin. For vitamin K to participate in the carboxylation of factors II, VII, IX, and X, it must be in a reduced form. It becomes an epoxide as carboxylation occurs and is recycled to its reduced form by a vitamin K reductase ({24:Whitlon et al., 1978}). Warfarin has an inhibitory effect on the reductase. The genetic defect in warfarin resistance in both man and rat may result in an altered affinity of the enzyme for the drug.",0.48,0.4,"['Coumarin resistance', 'CYP2A6', ' CYP2A3', ' CYP2A', ' P450C2A']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mephenytoin hydroxylation is a stereospecific reaction and is confined to the S-enantiomer, which is normally eliminated within hours. The R-enantiomer accumulates, requiring days or weeks for elimination. The inborn deficiency of mephenytoin hydroxylation prevents the rapid elimination of S-mephenytoin, which lingers in the body along with R-mephenytoin. Hydantoin levels in the blood are thus doubled, with toxic consequences. {7:Kalow (1986)} stated that there was no clinical evidence that the mephenytoin hydroxylation defect affects any other drug. Mephenytoin is 3-methyl 5,5-phenyl-ethyl-hydantoin. Phenytoin (see {132810}), or diphenylhydantoin, is metabolized by a different system ({14:Spielberg, 1988}). Although both are anticonvulsants and chemically similar hydantoins, phenytoin and mephenytoin differ in their biologic action and their interaction with drug-metabolizing enzymes.

Oral legend has it that the poor metabolizer phenotype was discovered when the head of the pharmacology unit in England that was testing debrisoquine as an antihypertensive agent collapsed with vascular hypotension on taking a trial dose of the new drug. He was found to be a 'poor metabolizer' (PM), showing greater sensitivity to the antihypertensive effects of the drug ({22:Idle et al., 1978}).

{32:Mahgoub et al. (1977)} found a sharp bimodality in the ratio of urinary debrisoquine to its oxidized metabolite 4-hydroxydebrisoquine in individuals after an oral dose of 10 mg of debrisoquine. About 3% of the study population were poor or nonmetabolizers, and the authors showed that a polymorphism in hydroxylation of the drug was responsible. Family data suggested that the poor metabolizers were homozygous for a recessive gene, although an extensive and systemic family study was not reported.

{19:Gonzalez et al. (1988)} described 2 phenotypes: poor metabolizers and extensive metabolizers (EM) of debrisoquine. EM individuals, displaying the wildtype phenotype (and presumably genotype), excreted 10 to 200 times more of the urinary metabolite 4-hydroxydebrisoquine than poor metabolizers. The phenotype extended to the metabolism of more than 25 commonly prescribed medications including neuroleptics, antidepressants, and beta-adrenergic blockers ({24:Johansson et al., 1993}).

{41:Waring et al. (1981)} suggested that sulfoxidation of mucodyne may be regulated by the same gene that controls the oxidation of debrisoquine. Poor hydroxylators of debrisoquine also have impaired metabolism of many other drugs such as phenacetin, nortriptyline, phenformin, sparteine, encainide, propranolol, bufuralol, guanoxan, perhexilene, and amitriptyline ({33:Mellstrom et al., 1981}; {35:Oates et al., 1982}; {23:Inaba et al., 1980}; {21:Harmer et al., 1986}). {31:Lennard et al. (1982)} demonstrated that metabolism of metoprolol, a beta-1-selective adrenoceptor antagonist, exhibited genetic polymorphism of the debrisoquine type. In patients taking the same dose, they found a 17-fold difference in plasma concentrations of metoprolol. Moreover, poor hydroxylators needed only a single daily dose of metoprolol for therapeutic effect, whereas extensive hydroxylators needed 2 or 3 doses a day. {30:Lennard et al. (1983)} identified at least 14 other drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 including the antiarrhythmic agent propafenone, a sodium-channel blocker with some structural similarity to propranolol. {29:Lee et al. (1990)} presented evidence that genetically determined variations in the conversion of propafenone to its 5-hydroxy metabolite accounts for variations in the drug's beta-blocking action. Slow converters (poor metabolizers) showed greater beta-blockade.

{19:Gonzalez et al. (1988)} showed that poor metabolizers have negligible amounts of the cytochrome P450DB1 protein (CYP2D6). {34:Nebert (1997)} estimated that CYP2D6 may be involved in the metabolism of as many as 20% of all commonly prescribed drugs.

<Subhead> Ultrarapid Metabolizers

In addition to deficient hydroxylation of debrisoquine, the opposite phenomenon exists; certain individuals metabolize debrisoquine and several other commonly used drugs very rapidly, resulting in subtherapeutic plasma concentrations at normal doses. {3,4:Bertilsson et al. (1985, 1993)} reported cases in which higher than normal doses of drugs were required to attain therapeutic concentrations. {2:Baumann et al.

<Subhead> Genetic Heterogeneity of Parkinson Disease

Several loci for autosomal dominant Parkinson disease have been identified, including PARK1 ({168601}) and PARK4, caused by mutation in or triplication of the alpha-synuclein gene (SNCA; {163890}), respectively, on 4q22; PARK5 ({191342}), caused by mutation in the UCHL1 gene on 4p13; PARK8 ({607060}), caused by mutation in the LRRK2 gene ({609007}) on 12q12; PARK11 ({607688}), caused by mutation in the GIGYF2 gene ({612003}) on 2q37; PARK13 ({610297}), caused by mutation in the HTRA2 gene ({606441}) on 2p13; PARK17 ({614203}), caused by mutation in the VPS35 gene ({601501}) on 16q11; PARK18 ({614251}), caused by mutation in the EIF4G1 gene ({600495}) on 3q27; PARK22 ({616710}), caused by mutation in the CHCHD2 gene ({616244}) on 7p11; and PARK24 ({619491}), caused by mutation in the PSAP gene ({176801}) on 10q22.

Several loci for autosomal recessive early-onset Parkinson disease have been identified: PARK2 ({600116}), caused by mutation in the gene encoding parkin (PRKN, PARK2; {602544}) on 6q26; PARK6 ({605909}), caused by mutation in the PINK1 gene ({608309}) on 1p36; PARK7 ({606324}), caused by mutation in the DJ1 gene (PARK7; {602533}) on 1p36; PARK14 ({612953}), caused by mutation in the PLA2G6 gene ({603604}) on 22q13; PARK15 ({260300}), caused by mutation in the FBXO7 gene ({605648}) on 22q12-q13; PARK19A ({615528}) and PARK19B (see {615528}), caused by mutation in the DNAJC6 gene ({608375}) on 1p32; PARK20 ({615530}), caused by mutation in the SYNJ1 gene ({604297}) on 21q22; and PARK23 ({616840}), caused by mutation in the VPS13C gene ({608879}) on 15q22; and PARK25 ({620482}), caused by mutation in the PTPA gene ({600756}) on 9q34.

PARK3 ({602404}) has been mapped to chromosome 2p13; PARK10 ({606852}) has been mapped to chromosome 1p34-p32; PARK16 ({613164}) has been mapped to chromosome 1q32. See also PARK21 ({616361}). A locus on the X chromosome has been identified (PARK12; {300557}). There is also evidence that mitochondrial mutations may cause or contribute to Parkinson disease (see {556500}).

Susceptibility to the development of the more common late-onset form of Parkinson disease has been associated with polymorphisms or mutations in several genes, including GBA ({606463}), MAPT ({157140}), MC1R ({155555}), ADH1C ({103730}), and genes at the HLA locus (see, e.g., HLA-DRA, {142860}). Each of these risk factors independently may have a modest effect on disease development, but together may have a substantial cumulative effect ({45:Hamza et al., 2010}).

Susceptibility to PD may also be conferred by expanded trinucleotide repeats in several genes causing other neurologic disorders usually characterized by spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA), including the ATXN2 ({601517}), ATXN3 ({607047}), TBP ({600075}), and ATXN8OS ({603680}) genes.","The diagnosis of classic idiopathic PD is primarily clinical, with manifestations including resting tremor, muscular rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability. Additional features are characteristic postural abnormalities, dysautonomia, dystonic cramps, and dementia. The disease is progressive and usually has an insidious onset in mid to late adulthood. Pathologic features of classic PD include by a loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) and the presence of Lewy bodies, intracellular inclusions, in surviving neurons in various areas of the brain, particularly the SN ({82:Nussbaum and Polymeropoulos, 1997}). Autosomal recessive juvenile Parkinson disease (PARK2; {600116}), however, does not have Lewy body pathology ({82:Nussbaum and Polymeropoulos, 1997}).

Many other diseases, both genetic and nongenetic, have parkinsonian motor features ('parkinsonism'), which most likely result from loss or dysfunction of the dopaminergic neurons in the SN, but may or may not have Lewy bodies on pathology. Thus, accurate diagnosis may be difficult without pathologic examination. Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB; {127750}) shows parkinsonism with Lewy bodies. However, parkinsonism without Lewy bodies characterizes progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP; {601104}), frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism ({600274}), autosomal dominant ({128230}) and recessive ({605407}) forms of Segawa syndrome, X-linked recessive Filipino type of dystonia ({314250}), multiple systems atrophy, and cerebrovascular disease.",0.93,0.91,"['Parkinson disease, late-onset, susceptibility to', 'ATXN2', ' ATX2', ' SCA2', ' ASL13']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The severity and additional manifestations varied among the patients. All patients had delayed psychomotor development; intellectual disability ranged from mild to moderate in most patients, with only 4 patients being classified as having severe to profound deficits. Similarly, speech was usually delayed, and a few patients were nonverbal. Patients were able to attend either special or mainstream schools with additional support. Most patients had mildly delayed walking by 2 years, although a few did not achieve independent ambulation until age 5 or 6 years. Only 5 patients had seizures, and the severity ranged from epileptic encephalopathy to a single seizure. Additional common features included short stature, strabismus, hypermetropia, hypotonia, sleeping difficulties, and distal mild skeletal anomalies, such as small hands and feet, tapering fingers, clinodactyly, sandal gap, and flat feet. Most patients had a variety of behavioral abnormalities, such as poor social interaction, autistic features, stereotypic movements, hyperactivity, short attention span, and aggressive outbursts. Dysmorphic features were common, but there was not a distinctive gestalt. Some of these features included small head circumference, downslanting palpebral fissures, strabismus, deep-set eyes, hypertelorism, low-set ears, long philtrum, long eyelashes, narrow mouth, everted lower lip, and long face.

Some patients present with recurrent respiratory infections or other viral infections. In many cases, the susceptibility to viral infections due to IMD106 only becomes apparent after initial vaccination with live attenuated viral (LAV) vaccines, most notably MMR and yellow fever. A subset of IMD106 patients who demonstrate adverse reactions to MMR or other LAV vaccinations develop a severe acute hyperinflammatory response reminiscent of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) and may show encephalopathy, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and multiorgan failure. However, some patients with IMD106 tolerate MMR vaccination without sequelae. IFNAR1 deficiency may also predispose to severe respiratory infection with SARS-CoV-2 and to herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV1) encephalitis (HSE). The disorder results from an impaired type I interferon signaling response ({2:Bastard et al., 2022}).","{5:Hernandez et al. (2019)} reported 2 unrelated children who presented with a hyperinflammatory response soon after vaccination with live attenuated vaccines for MMR and yellow fever, respectively. Neither showed features of immunodeficiency before vaccination. P1 was a 9-year-old boy born of consanguineous Iranian parents who presented at about 12 months of age with disseminated vaccine-strain measles after vaccination with MMR. He had fever, neurologic symptoms consistent with encephalitis, and leukocytosis in the CSF. He had previously received hepatitis B virus, BCG, and influenza vaccines without adverse effect. Antibodies against measles and mumps were at the low limits of normal, whereas responses to pneumococcal and hepatitis B were normal. He had frequent upper respiratory infections, but had normal development and was in good health at 9 years of age. A sister had died in infancy of meningoencephalitis after receiving MMR vaccine. P2 was a 14-year-old girl, born of unrelated Brazilian parents, who presented at age 12 years with fever, encephalitis, acute renal and hepatic failure, and leukocytosis following vaccination for yellow fever. She made a full recovery and was healthy at age 14. She had previously received 2 MMR vaccines and oral live poliovirus and BCG in early childhood without incident. {6:Khanmohammadi et al. (2022)} reported follow-up of P1, who presented with a severe COVID-19 respiratory infection requiring hospitalization at age 13 years. In addition to MMR-associated meningitis in infancy, he had a history of recurrent hospitalizations due to infection with influenza virus. Treatment with gamma-interferon (IFNG; {147570}) resulted in clinical improvement, and he was eventually discharged. These findings indicated that patients with INFAR1 deficiency may be predisposed to severe COVID-19 infections.

{4:Gothe et al. (2022)} reported a previously healthy 15-month-old boy, born of consanguineous parents, who developed a severe fatal hyperinflammatory response to MMR vaccination. He met the diagnostic criteria for HLH and died 6 months later. Analysis of serum and CSF did not showed vaccine-strain viral replication, but low-level EBV was detected.

{3:Bastard et al. (2021)} reported a girl, born of consanguineous Palestinian parents, who had recurrent viral infections in infancy and developed HSV encephalitis (HSE), resulting in death around 20 months of age. Prior to this, she had developed a fever following MMR vaccination, but it resolved spontaneously. A first cousin of the patient (P3) died at age 12 months following a severe adverse reaction to MMR vaccination. P2, who was the sib of P3, had episodes of aseptic meningitis in infancy that may have been related to HSV. At age 14 years, P2 developed parotiditis followed by bilateral hearing loss. This episode was strongly suspected to be due to mumps infection; he had not received MMR vaccination per the family's request. Serum analysis of P2 showed the presence of antibodies to various viruses, including HSV1, VZV, CMV, EBV, measles, and mumps.

{2:Bastard et al. (2022)} reported 7 patients from 5 unrelated families of western Polynesian origin who presented in the first months or year of life with severe life-threatening viral infections. Six of the 7 patients developed an acute adverse systemic hyperinflammatory reaction within days to weeks after vaccination with live attenuated MMR vaccine. Features included fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, encephalopathy, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Most of these patients also developed thrombocytopenia, anemia, hyperferritinemia, dyslipidemia, coagulopathy, and increased levels of soluble CD25 (IL2RA; {147730}) with evidence of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). Vaccine-strain measles and mumps were detected in tissue from some of the patients. Three patients (P1-P3) died in infancy of multiorgan failure soon after the MMR vaccination, whereas a fourth patient (P4) initially recovered, but died of RSV infection several months later. P5, the brother of P4, was a 7-year-old boy who developed aseptic meningoencephalitis and features of hyperinflammation initially diagnosed as Kawasaki disease ({611775}) 17 days after his first MMR vaccine at age 16 months. He recovered and tolerated the second MMR dose without complications. P5 had no neurocognitive deficits, but demonstrated unilateral sensorineural hearing loss, possibly a sequela of mumps infection. P6 had recurrent viral pneumonia in the first year of life and showed an acute inflammatory reaction to MMR with viral encephalitis at age 14 months. He subsequently had multiple viral respiratory infections, including RSV and parainfluenza virus, necessitating extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO); thereafter he demonstrated bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, global developmental delay, and autism spectrum disorder. Four of the 6 patients with a severe reaction to MMR were noted to have viral infections prior to the first MMR vaccine, including respiratory infections with bronchiolitis (P4 and P5), recurrent viral pneumonia (P6), and enteroviral meningoencephalitis (P3). However, 2 sibs from family A (P1 and P2) were healthy before MMR vaccination at age 12 months and tolerated live attenuated vaccination with BCG and oral polio. P7 presented at 10 months of age with hemophilus influenza type B (Hib) bacteremia and meningitis complicated by seizures, and later developed RSV-associated respiratory insufficiency and multiorgan failure requiring ECMO. P7 received MMR vaccine at ages 4 and 4.5 years without complications; she was the only patient of the cohort who tolerated MMR vaccination. She also had developmental delay that may have been unrelated to the IMD phenotype.

The disorder occurs in 2 clinical forms: homozygous and heterozygous ({68:Hobbs et al., 1992}).

The FHCL1 phenotype can be modified by mutation in other genes. For example, in individuals with the LDLR mutation IVS14+1G-A ({606945.0063}), the phenotype can be altered by a SNP in the APOA2 gene ({107670.0002}), a SNP in the EPHX2 gene ({132811.0001}), or a SNP in the GHR gene ({600946.0028}).

<Subhead> Genetic Heterogeneity of Familial Hypercholesterolemia

Other forms of monogenic familial hypercholesterolemia include FHCL2 ({144010}), caused by mutation in the APOB gene ({107730}); FHCL3 ({603776}), caused by mutation in the PCSK9 gene ({607786}); and FHCL4 ({603813}), caused by mutation in the LDLRAP1 gene ({605747}).","Individuals with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia develop tendinous xanthomas, corneal arcus, and coronary artery disease; the last usually becomes evident in the fourth or fifth decade. Homozygous individuals have a more severe clinical picture with earlier presentation, usually in the first 2 decades of life ({68:Hobbs et al., 1992}).

The ranges of serum cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol are, in mg per dl, 250-450 and 200-400 in heterozygotes, greater than 500 and greater than 450 in homozygous affecteds, and 150-250 and 75-175 in homozygous unaffecteds, with some positive correlation with age ({84:Khachadurian, 1964}; {94:Kwiterovich et al., 1974}).

In homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, the aortic root is prone to develop atherosclerotic plaque at an early age. Such plaques can accumulate in unusual sites, such as the ascending aorta and around the coronary ostia. {131:Summers et al. (1998)} evaluated the aortic root using MRI imaging in a blinded, prospective study of 17 homozygous FH patients and 12 healthy controls. When patient age and body mass index were taken into account, 53% of patients with homozygous FH had increased aortic wall thickness compared to controls; this was thought to result from a combination of medial hyperplasia and plaque formation. Supravalvular aortic stenosis was seen in 41% of patients.

{77:Houlston et al. (1988)} studied the relationship of lipoprotein(a) ({152200}) levels and coronary heart disease in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia. Individuals with coronary artery disease had a significantly higher mean lipoprotein(a) concentration than those without coronary heart disease, suggesting that lipoprotein(a) measurements may help predict the risk of coronary heart disease in individuals with familial hypercholesterolemia.

Molecular studies ({38:Reijo et al., 1995}; {50:Vogt et al., 1996}; {37:Pryor et al., 1997}, {15:Foresta et al., 2001}) have since shown that microdeletions at Yq11 may represent the etiologic factor in as many as 10 to 20% of cases with idiopathic azoospermia or severe oligozoospermia. Most of the deletions occur de novo and fall in 3 nonoverlapping regions, designated AZFa, AZFb, and AZFc (see {50:Vogt et al., 1996}), of which the distally located AZFc is most frequently deleted ({51:Yen, 1998}).

{15:Foresta et al.

The late onset and discordance in a pair of identical twins suggested that environmental factors may be important also. {6:Miller (1971)} reported affected sisters. {10:Von Maur et al. (1974)} described a family in which autosomal dominant inheritance of aspirin asthma was suggested. In addition to mode of inheritance, differences from prior reports included an earlier age of onset, lack of nasal polyps and sinusitis, and milder asthma.

{9:Spector et al. (1979)} found that oral challenge with aspirin caused bronchoconstriction in 19% of consecutive adult asthma patients, and other studies involving challenge with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in both adults and children with asthma confirm a prevalence of 10 to 20%. Aspirin causes bronchoconstriction in aspirin-intolerant asthma (AIA) patients by triggering cysteinyl-leukotriene production, probably by removing PGE(2)-dependent inhibition. To investigate why aspirin does not cause bronchoconstriction in all individuals, {3:Cowburn et al. (1998)} immunostained enzymes of the leukotriene and prostanoid pathways in bronchial biopsies from AIA patients, aspirin-tolerant asthma (ATA) patients, and normal (N) subjects. Counts of cells expressing the terminal enzyme for cysteinyl-leukotriene synthesis, LTC4 synthase ({246530}), were 5-fold higher in AIA biopsies than in ATA biopsies and 18-fold higher than in N biopsies. Aspirin may remove PGE(2)-dependent suppression in all subjects, but only in AIA patients does increased bronchial expression of LTC4 synthase allow marked overproduction of cysteinyl-leukotriene leading to bronchoconstriction. {3:Cowburn et al. (1998)} speculated that a polymorphism directed to the regulation of LTC4 synthase expression could be a predisposing factor for the AIA group.

{2:Arm and Austen (2002)} stated that between 3% and 10% of asthma patients have acute, severe asthma accompanied by rhinorrhea and sometimes associated with hives, flushing, or abdominal pain after the injection of aspirin or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The common feature of drugs that provoke asthma attacks in aspirin-intolerant persons is that they inhibit cyclooxygenase-1 (COX1; {176805}); selective inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2; {600262}) appears not to provoke such a response. Cautious, incremental administration of oral doses of aspirin can lead to a state in which persons with aspirin-sensitive asthma can ingest aspirin without untoward reactions, but daily administration must be continued to maintain this state.

Patients with asthma and aspirin sensitivity have greater cysteinyl leukotriene production and greater airway hyperresponsiveness to the effects of inhaled cysteinyl leukotrienes than their aspirin-tolerant counterparts. {8:Sousa et al. (2002)} hypothesized that the latter effect reflects elevated expression of the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor CYSLT1 ({300201}) on inflammatory cells in the target organ and that its expression is downregulated by aspirin desensitization. They found elevated numbers of nasal inflammatory leukocytes expressing the CYSLT1 receptor in aspirin-sensitive patients with chronic rhinosinusitis as compared with their non-aspirin-sensitive counterparts and the downregulation of receptor expression after desensitization to aspirin.",,0.38,"['Asthma and nasal polyps', 'TBX21', ' TBET', ' IMD88']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The terminology Le(a) and Le(b) is misleading, as these antigens are not allelic. The Le gene, FUT3, encodes an alpha-1,4-L-fucosyltransferase that catalyzes the addition of a fucose residue to the H antigen to produce Le(b) or to the precursor of H to produce Le(a). The presence of H antigen in secretions is governed by the FUT2 gene ({182100}). Thus, red cells of most H secretors, who have a functional FUT2 enzyme, are Le(a-b+), and those of H nonsecretors (see {182100.0001}), who have a nonfunctional FUT2 enzyme, are Le(a+b-). FUT3 can also convert A antigen to ALe(b) and B antigen to BLe(b) (see {110300}). About 6% of white people and 25% of black people are homozygous for loss-of-function FUT2 mutations (e.g., {111100.0001}) and therefore have Le(a-b-) red cells and lack Lewis substances in their secretions. In Asia, the red cell phenotype Le(a+b+) is common and results from a weak secretor allele in FUT2 ({182100.0002}). The Le(c) and Le(d) antigens represent precursors of the Le antigens and are present in increased quantities in plasma of Le(a-b-) individuals. The Le(x) and Le(y) antigens are isomers of Le(a) and Le(b), respectively, and are not present in substantial quantities on red cells. Although Le antibodies are relatively common, hemolytic transfusion reactions are rare, and Le antibodies do not cause serious hemolytic disease of the newborn (summary by {2:Daniels, 2002}).",,0.48,,"['Blood group, Lewis', 'FUT3', ' LE']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
188,188,27514,slc12a1,OMIM:601678,"Bartter syndrome, type 1","['SLC12A1', ' NKCC2']","Bartter syndrome refers to a group of disorders that are unified by autosomal recessive transmission of impaired salt reabsorption in the thick ascending loop of Henle with pronounced salt wasting, hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis, and hypercalciuria. Clinical disease results from defective renal reabsorption of sodium chloride in the thick ascending limb (TAL) of the Henle loop, where 30% of filtered salt is normally reabsorbed ({13:Simon et al., 1997}).

Patients with antenatal forms of Bartter syndrome typically present with premature birth associated with polyhydramnios and low birth weight and may develop life-threatening dehydration in the neonatal period. Patients with classic Bartter syndrome (see BARTS3, {607364}) present later in life and may be sporadically asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic (summary by {14:Simon et al., 1996} and {2:Fremont and Chan, 2012}).

For a discussion of genetic heterogeneity of Bartter syndrome, see {607364}.","The antenatal form of Bartter syndrome is a life-threatening disorder in which both renal tubular hypokalemic alkalosis and profound systemic symptoms are manifest ({12:Seyberth et al., 1985}; {1:Deschenes et al., 1993}; and {10:Proesmans et al., 1985}). The abnormalities begin in utero with marked fetal polyuria that leads to polyhydramnios between 24 and 30 weeks of gestation and, typically, premature delivery ({9:Ohlsson et al., 1984}). The amniotic fluid contains high chloride levels but normal concentrations of sodium, potassium, calcium, and prostaglandin E2. Affected neonates have severe salt wasting and hyposthenuria, moderate hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis, hyperprostaglandinuria, and failure to thrive. The {4:International Collaborative Study Group for Bartter-like Syndromes (1997)} noted that an essential manifestation of the antenatal variant is marked hypercalciuria, and as a secondary consequence, affected infants develop nephrocalcinosis and osteopenia. Fever, vomiting, and occasional diarrhea associated with the disorder have been attributed to the stimulation of renal and systemic prostaglandin E2 activity in affected infants; these symptoms are effectively treated with inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis. Based on these clinical features, the antenatal form of Bartter syndrome has been referred to as the hyperprostaglandin E syndrome ({11:Seyberth et al., 1987}).

<Subhead> Clinical Variability

{5:Kurtz et al. (1997)} studied a cohort of 20 Costa Rican patients, previously described by {7:Madrigal et al. (1997)}, who had a congenital syndrome that bore strong similarities to antenatal Bartter syndrome type 1 but also had several distinct features. In all patients, pregnancy was complicated by polyhydramnios, and 7 of the 9 patients were born prematurely. Six of 9 patients studied in detail were presented for evaluation within the first year of life. One was not diagnosed until the age of 10 years and another was 4.5 years old at the time of diagnosis. All affected children had experienced recurrent episodes of vomiting and dehydration, dating from the first few weeks of life. The phenotype was remarkable for a peculiar facies in 7 of 9 children, characterized by a triangularly shaped face, protruding ears, and drooping mouth; in addition, 5 of 9 had strabismus, and there was evidence of sensorineural hearing loss by audiogram testing in 2 of 9. All had hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis, hyposthenuria, and failure to thrive, with growth parameters less than the 3rd centile for age. Hypercalciuria with associated sonographic evidence of nephrocalcinosis was demonstrated in 7 children. The other 2 children had evidence of nephrocalcinosis but normal urine calcium excretion. Renal function was well preserved in all but 1 patient, who developed renal insufficiency and progressed to end-stage renal disease by 16 years of age. Although the development of tubulointerstitial disease leading to a progressive decline in renal function had been described both in patients treated with long-term indomethacin and in patients with classic Bartter syndrome, this patient was not treated with indomethacin, and the etiology of her end-stage renal disease remained unexplained. {5:Kurtz et al. (1997)} noted that the Costa Rican patients had a milder clinical course than other antenatal Bartter syndrome patients with NKCC2 (SLC12A1) mutations.

{3:Gross et al. (2015)} reported a 5-month-old boy, born of consanguineous Arab Muslim parents with an unusual presentation of BARTS1. The delivery was complicated by polyhydramnios, and he was diagnosed with nephrocalcinosis in the neonatal period. After treatment with antibiotics for a febrile illness at age 3 months, he developed severe diarrhea with weight loss. Laboratory studies at age 5 months showed increased serum calcium, hypercalciuria, and hyperparathyroidism, but other electrolytes were normal. Specifically, he did not have hypokalemia or metabolic alkalosis. Head and neck ultrasound did not show a parathyroid adenoma. Treatment with potassium citrate was effective for the biochemical abnormalities, but he showed significant developmental delay with hypotonia at age 10 months. {3:Gross et al. (2015)} suggested that the abnormality in renal calcium homeostasis may have triggered changes in parathyroid hormone (PTH; {168450}) secretion. Whole-exome sequencing identified a homozygous frameshift mutation in the SLC12A1 gene, confirming the diagnosis.

{6:Li et al. (2016)} reported 2 African American brothers with BARTS1 associated with hyperparathyroidism, hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and nephrocalcinosis. Both pregnancies were complicated by polyhydramnios and premature delivery. The proband's brother died of multiorgan failure at 9 weeks, and postmortem examination showed multigland parathyroid hyperplasia. The 12-year-old proband continued to have persistent hypercalciuria and increased PTH levels with normal bone density. Other electrolytes were only mildly disturbed: he had mildly low sodium, potassium, chloride, and magnesium, and mildly increased bicarbonate. Plasma renin, vasopressin, and urinary prostaglandin E2 were increased. He was treated with cinacalcet and potassium citrate. Neck ultrasound did not reveal a parathyroid adenoma.

Additional features included poor overall growth, failure to thrive, respiratory insufficiency, and gastroesophageal reflux.

222,222,33457,nqo2,OMIM:114480,"Breast cancer, lobular, somatic","['CDH1', ' UVO', ' LCAM', ' ECAD', ' BCDS1']","Breast cancer (referring to mammary carcinoma, not mammary sarcoma) is histopathologically and almost certainly etiologically and genetically heterogeneous. Important genetic factors have been indicated by familial occurrence and bilateral involvement.","{21:Cady (1970)} described a family in which 3 sisters had bilateral breast cancer. Together with reports in the literature, this suggested to him the existence of families with a particular tendency to early-onset, bilateral breast cancer. The genetic basis might, of course, be multifactorial.

{5:Anderson (1974)} concluded that the sisters of women with breast cancer whose mothers also had breast cancer have a risk 47 to 51 times that in control women; a revised estimate was 39 times ({6:Anderson, 1976}). The disease in these women usually developed before menopause, was often bilateral, and seemed to be associated with ovarian function. About 30% of daughters with early-onset, bilateral breast cancer inherited the susceptibility. The risk of breast cancer to women with affected relatives is higher when the diagnosis is made at an early age and when the disease is bilateral. {108:Ottman et al. (1983)} provided tables that give the cumulative risk of breast cancer to mothers and sisters at various ages. The highest risk group is sisters of premenstrual probands with bilateral disease. Among the sisters of women with breast cancer, {3:Anderson and Badzioch (1985)} found the highest lifetime risks when the proband had bilateral disease, an affected mother (25 +/- 7.2%), or an affected sister (28 +/- 11%). The risks were reduced to 18 +/- 3.3% and 14 +/- 2.6%, respectively, with unilateral disease. An early example of familial breast cancer was provided by {17:Broca (1866)}. According to the pedigree drawn by {86:Lynch (1976)}, 10 women in 4 generations of the family of Broca's wife died of breast cancer. {39:Eisinger et al. (1998)} called attention to an even earlier report of hereditary breast cancer by {79:Le Dran (1757)}, who related the experience of a colleague in Avignon who had diagnosed a 19-year-old nun with cancer of the right breast. The patient refused a mastectomy not only because of the pain of surgery, but also because of a belief that the operation would be futile. Her grandmother and a grandmaternal uncle died with breast cancer, and she was convinced that this malady was hereditary and that 'her blood was corrupted by a cancerous ferment natural to her family.'

Two families with an extraordinary incidence of male breast cancer and father-to-son transmission of same was reported by {41:Everson et al. (1976)}. They found a suggestion of elevated urinary estrogen in 3 of the affected males. {138:Teasdale et al. (1976)} described breast cancer in 2 brothers and in a daughter of 1 brother. {74:Kozak et al. (1986)} reported breast cancer in 2 related males, an uncle and nephew. In this family and in several reported families with male breast cancer, {74:Kozak et al. (1986)} found women in the same family with breast cancer.

Soft tissue sarcomas are associated with breast cancer in Li-Fraumeni syndrome. {101:Mulvihill (1982)} used the term cancer family syndrome of Lynch ({120435}) for the association of colon and endometrial carcinoma and other neoplasms including breast cancer.

{127:Seltzer et al. (1990)} concluded that dermatoglyphics can help in the identification of women either with or at risk for breast cancer. They found that the presence of 6 or more whorls is associated in a statistically significant manner with breast cancer.

{90:Marger et al. (1975)} presented the cases of 2 brothers with breast cancer and reviewed the courses of 28 other previously unreported male patients. In one of the brothers, breast cancer was preceded by prostate cancer and estrogen administration, raising the possibility that the breast cancer was a metastatic deposit. The possibility of prostatic metastases was raised in 2 other patients. {36:Demeter et al. (1990)} reported breast cancer in a 64-year-old man who had had bilateral gynecomastia since childhood. His maternal grandfather had been found to have adenocarcinoma of the breast at the age of 65. His maternal grandmother had radical mastectomy for breast cancer at the age of 66 and 2 years later underwent radiation therapy for rib metastases. The proband's sister developed breast cancer at the age of 31 years and despite aggressive therapy died 1 year later with extensive metastases.

{56:Hauser et al. (1992)} reported a family in which 2 females and 2 males in 2 generations had breast cancer. Two females in the family had prophylactic bilateral mastectomy at a young age. One male developed a left breast mass and axillary node at age 59 and died of metastatic disease at age 62. His paternal uncle presented at age 57 years with bleeding from his right breast. Biopsy suggested Paget disease of the breast and he underwent mastectomy. He subsequently died at age 75 years of prostatic carcinoma. He had a daughter who developed breast cancer at age 27 years and died at age 30 with disseminated disease, and a son who developed infiltrating grade 4 adenocarcinoma of the breast at age 54.",0.27,0.51,"['Breast cancer, lobular, somatic', 'CDH1', ' UVO', ' LCAM', ' ECAD', ' BCDS1']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
223,223,33533,pnlip,OMIM:614338,Pancreatic lipase deficiency,"['PNLIP', ' PNLIPD']","Congenital pancreatic lipase deficiency is a rare, monoenzymatic form of exocrine pancreatic failure. All reported patients have presented with similar symptoms and clinical findings, including oily/greasy stools from infancy or early childhood and the absence of discernible pancreatic disease. Failure to thrive has not been observed. Analyses of duodenal contents consistently show a marked decrease of pancreatic lipolytic activity (summary by {4:Figarella et al., 1980}).","{12:Sheldon (1964)} reported 4 children, a brother and sister and 2 brothers, from 2 unrelated nonconsanguineous families, who had congenital pancreatic lipase deficiency. From early infancy, all 4 were noted to have a greasy quality to their stools, with liquid oil separating from the stool and solidifying as the stool cooled. At an age when most children were gaining control of their bowel movements, these children were handicapped by soiling their clothes with liquid oil that they were unable to restrain. Analysis of duodenal fluid in the children showed total absence of pancreatic lipase in 1 boy and less than half the normal amount in the other 3 children. {12:Sheldon (1964)} stated that the disorder could be distinguished from other causes of steatorrhea such as fibrocystic disease of the pancreas and celiac disease due to satisfactory growth, lack of abdominal distention, and lack of respiratory infections leading to lung damage. The author also noted that despite greatly decreased production of pancreatic lipase, fat absorption in the 3 children in whom it was analyzed was approximately 70%, suggesting action of lipase derived from the stomach and intestine. Treatment with lipase given as pancreatin improved fat absorption, although not to normal levels, and brought the oily condition of the stools and soiling under control; dietary control of fat intake, however, remained necessary, with any excess intake leading to a return of oil in the stools and soiling.

{11:Rey et al. (1966)} reported a 10-year-old boy who at 3 years of age developed episodes of abundant, greasy diarrhea that coincided with asthmatic attacks. By 5 years of age, his stools were consistently greasy and voluminous, occurring once or twice a day with excessive oil that separated out, and despite being continent, his clothes were stained with oil seepage. A sweat chloride test was within normal limits, and analysis of duodenal fluid showed normal secretion of bicarbonates, slightly decreased trypsin (see {276000}) and amylase (see {104650}) activity, and virtually absent lipase activity. Absorption of sugars was normal, and a barium study of the small intestine and jejunal and pancreatic biopsies were all normal. The fat in his stools decreased by 50% when pancreatic extract was added to his diet, but increased immediately to previous levels when the treatment was stopped. {11:Rey et al. (1966)} noted that the delayed onset in this patient was suggestive of an acquired disorder, but the persistent absence of pancreatic lipase at 8 years of age showed similarity to the 4 patients described by {12:Sheldon (1964)}.

{1:Balzer (1967)} studied an 8-year-old girl who had abundant fatty stools from around 1 year of age, which did not improve with the use of charcoal. She had normal growth and development. Pancreatic function tests showed complete absence of lipase activity, with slightly reduced protease activity and normal amylase activity; lipase activity remained very low even after vagal stimulation. Follow-up for more than a decade showed continued symptoms, but good growth and development; she did well in school and participated in sports. Based on the history and findings, {1:Balzer (1967)} concluded that the patient had a congenital enzymopathy, most likely autosomal recessive in nature, since both parents were healthy and the patient had 2 healthy brothers.

{8:Larbre et al. (1969)} reported a 10-year-old girl with congenital lipase deficiency who developed chronic greasy diarrhea at 10 months of age when breastfeeding was discontinued and whole milk introduced into her diet. She was otherwise healthy and had normal growth and development; she had 2 younger brothers who were healthy. The coefficient of fat absorption in the patient was 62%, and analysis of enzyme activity in her duodenal fluid demonstrated an almost total lack of lipase activity. Symptomatic improvement was minimal with pancreatic extract alone, and it was discontinued by the family; the patient's mother stated that limiting her daughter's intake of fats to 40 to 50 g per day normalized her stools. {8:Larbre et al. (1969)} noted that similar to previous reports, there was a striking discrepancy between the voluminous steatorrhea and the patient's overall good state of health.

{14:Verger et al. (1971)} reported a 9-year-old boy who had severe steatorrhea from 2 years of age, in whom examination of duodenal fluid revealed decreased pancreatic lipase activity. In contrast to previous reports, replacing dietary animal fat with corn oil increased the patient's coefficient of fat absorption from 60% to 82%. Effective treatment measures included high doses of pancreatic extract and extreme reduction of dietary fat, to 20 g of corn oil per day.

In a 9-year-old girl who had large greasy stools from 3 months of age and complete lack of pancreatic lipase activity in duodenal fluid, {5:Figarella et al. (1972)} demonstrated that pancreatic colipase ({120105}) was present and unaffected.

{10:Muller et al. (1975)} reported a patient in whom, despite complete absence of pancreatic lipase, more than 50% of dietary fat was absorbed. Studies to elucidate the mechanism of fat absorption suggested that in the absence of pancreatic lipase, gastric lipase ({601980}) and pancreatic esterase ({114840}) may play an important compensatory role in the absorption of dietary fat.

Using immunologic and enzymatic techniques to study a 46-year-old man who had steatorrhea from at least age 20 years, {3:Figarella et al. (1979)} demonstrated a complete lack of pancreatic lipase, but normal levels of colipase. Duodenal fluid from the patient, in which no pancreatic lipase activity could be detected, was capable of reactivating pure pancreatic lipase inhibited by a high concentration of biliary salts, thus indicating the presence of colipase.

In a 5.5-year-old boy of German parentage who from infancy had greasy/oily stools, {4:Figarella et al. (1980)} found absence of pancreatic lipase in duodenal contents after stimulation with secretin/pancreozymin. Colipase, however, was present, consistent with independent synthesis of the 2 enzymes. Stool bulk and frequency decreased while on a fat-reduced diet. Addition of exogenous lipase to a diet with normal fat content did not appreciably change stool weight and frequency. Lard as a major source of dietary fat did not cause overtly greasy/oily stools, whereas such stools were again produced after ingestion of butterfat. At 11 years of age, the child was well within normal growth and development, and continued on a fat-reduced diet. {4:Figarella et al. (1980)} suggested that the poor clinical response to exogenous lipase might be due in part to denaturation in the acid milieu of the stomach, with the remaining activity inadequate to normalize fat digestion.

{2:Behar et al. (2014)} reported 15- and 19-year-old brothers, born to healthy first-cousin parents of Arab Muslim origin from central Israel, who had voluminous greasy stools from the first postnatal days of feeding. The brothers had no dysmorphic features or other abnormalities, and they had been treated with ADEK vitamin and pancreatic enzyme replacement since childhood, with partial compliance. Their body mass indices (BMIs) were in the 'underweight' range (22-23), despite very high caloric intake. Laboratory analysis in the affected brothers showed low lipase levels, low fecal elastase levels, and an abnormal pancreolauryl test. Biochemical analysis showed a marked decrease in PNLIP activity in the 2 brothers, with mildly reduced and low-normal levels in their father and mother, respectively. Vitamin A levels were in the normal range, but lower in the 2 affected brothers than in other family members, whereas vitamin D levels were 'insufficient' in the father as well as in 2 unaffected brothers, 'deficient' in the 2 affected brothers, and 'severely deficient' in their mother; vitamin E levels were low only in the 2 affected brothers.

<Subhead> Isolated Pancreatic Colipase Deficiency

{7:Hildebrand et al. (1982)} studied 2 Assyrian brothers, born of consanguineous parents, in whom loose stools developed at 5 and 6 years of age, respectively. Evaluation revealed steatorrhea, and analysis of exocrine pancreatic enzymes in the small intestine revealed isolated colipase deficiency, with normal levels of amylase, chymotrypsin ({601405}), and lipase. Intraduodenal infusion of purified colipase improved fat digestion measured by the triolein breath test, and the sibs' steatorrhea decreased on treatment with enteric-coated pancreatic enzymes. Both boys had gallstones, possibly related to malabsorption of bile salts associated with pancreatic insufficiency. The older brother also had megaloblastic anemia due to vitamin B12 deficiency; the authors noted that defective absorption of vitamin B12 had been observed in patients with pancreatic insufficiency ({13:Toskes et al., 1971}), and suggested that colipase might be involved in its absorption. {7:Hildebrand et al. (1982)} stated that this was the first report of isolated colipase deficiency, and noted that either lipase or colipase deficiency results in the same pattern of decreased fat absorption.

<Subhead> Combined Congenital Pancreatic Lipase and Colipase Deficiency

{6:Ghishan et al. (1984)} reported a 5-year-old boy who had a history of passing foul-smelling oily/greasy stools from birth. The stools became less greasy when skim milk feedings were begun at 2 months of age, but began again upon introduction of solid foods. Pancreatic stimulation tests showed that both lipase and colipase activities were less than 2% of normal values. The patient's fat absorption coefficient went from 50% to 82% upon supplementation with pancreatic enzymes. {6:Ghishan et al. (1984)} stated that this was the first report of congenital combined lipase and colipase deficiency.

{9:Ligumsky et al. (1990)} described 2 brothers of Arab origin, born to nonconsanguineous parents, who had isolated congenital lipase and colipase deficiency. Both sibs, who were 15 years and 10 years old, had passed greasy stools from infancy but were otherwise healthy and normally developed. Both had voluminous steatorrhea and low serum carotene and vitamin E concentrations, although there were no clinical signs of any lipid-soluble vitamin deficiency. After exocrine pancreatic stimulation, lipase activity in duodenal fluid from both brothers was less than 1.5% of the control value and colipase activity was almost completely absent, whereas amylase, trypsin, bile salts, and pH values were normal. {9:Ligumsky et al. (1990)} noted that fat absorption in the sibs was 70% and 79%, respectively, suggesting that in these patients extrapancreatic sources of lipase, such as lingual and gastric lipase, may have an important compensating role in fat digestion.",0.35,0.3,"['Pancreatic lipase deficiency', 'PNLIP', ' PNLIPD']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

229,229,35300,abcc11,OMIM:117800,"Axillary odor, variation in","['ABCC11', ' MRP8', ' EWWD', ' WW']",,"In Japanese, {8:Matsunaga (1962)} described a dimorphism of ear wax, the 2 types being wet and dry. This variation has been studied extensively in Japan since at least 1934. Less attention has been given to this variation elsewhere, probably because Caucasians and blacks have only the wet type of cerumen. In 80 to 85% of Japanese, the cerumen is gray, dry, and brittle. It is referred to as 'rice-bran ear wax' in Japanese. In the other Japanese, the cerumen is brown, sticky, and wet. This is referred to as 'honey ear wax,' 'oily ear wax' or 'cat ear wax.' In all except about 0.5% of Japanese, classification is simple. Family studies indicate monofactorial inheritance, with the rarer phenotype, wet wax, being dominant. Wet cerumen is often associated with axillary odor, which, because of its rarity in Japan, is considered in the lay mind a pathologic state requiring medical attention.

{10:Petrakis et al. (1967)} found a high frequency of dry cerumen in pure-blooded American Indians. No qualitative differences in the chemical composition of the dry and wet types of cerumen were identified by {4:Kataura and Kataura (1967)}.

{11:Petrakis (1971)} noted a positive correlation between wet ear wax and breast cancer in several countries and suggested an association. In a study of Chinese women in Hong Kong, {3:Ing et al. (1973)} could not confirm the association.

{2:Ibraimov (1991)} presented data on the high frequency of dry cerumen in Mongoloid populations and low frequency among Europoids. Intermediate frequencies were found among peoples of subequatorial Africa.

{14:Tomita et al. (2002)} noted that the difference in nature of wet and dry cerumen is attributed to secretory products of ceruminous glands. Histologic studies have shown abundant lipid droplets and pigment granules in the cytoplasm of secretory cells in individuals with wet cerumen, whereas these cytoplasmic components are scarce in individuals with dry cerumen ({8:Matsunaga, 1962}). The ceruminous gland is an apocrine gland, as are axillary and breast glands. In individuals with dry cerumen, the axillary apocrine gland is usually much less developed than in those with wet cerumen, and therefore the dry type is associated with less axillary odor.

The wet cerumen phenotype is completely dominant to the dry type. {15:Yoshiura et al. (2006)} stated that the dry ear wax type is seen frequently (80 to 95%) among East Asians, but uncommonly (0 to 3%) in populations of European and African origins. Intermediate frequencies (30 to 50%) of the dry type are seen in populations of southern Asia, the Pacific Islands, central Asia, and Asia Minor, as well as among the native North American and Inuit of Asian ancestry. These figures show geographic gradient distributions.

Among 225 Japanese women, {9:Miura et al. (2007)} reported an association between ear wax type and apocrine colostrum secretion from the mammary gland on the first postpartum day. The absence of colostrum secretion was more common among women with dry ear wax (105 of 155, 67.7%) compared to women with wet ear wax (28 of 70, 40%). The authors noted that both colostrum and cerumen have a common origin in the secretory glands and suggested that the ABCC11 gene product may play a role in colostrum secretion independent of endocrine control.",,0.48,"['Axillary odor, variation in', 'ABCC11', ' MRP8', ' EWWD', ' WW']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Serum from these children failed to opsonize the yeast S. cerevisiae with complement component-3 (C3; {120700}). A similar opsonic defect was present in approximately 5% of an adult population with no obvious immunodeficiency. {16:Super et al. (1989)} identified an association between low levels of MBL and a defect of opsonization that resulted in susceptibility to frequent and chronic infections. The frequency of this deficiency in the general population has been estimated to be between 5 and 10% ({18:Turner, 1991}). The deficiency has been reported to be particularly common in infants with recurrent respiratory tract infection, otitis media, and chronic diarrhea.

{14:Summerfield et al. (1995)} challenged the view that although MBL deficiency causes recurrent infections in infants between 6 and 18 months of age, it does not predispose to adult infections. They described 4 patients with severe and unusual infections in which MBL gene mutations were the only identified cause of immunodeficiency, and 1 patient with combined MBL and IgA deficiency. Infections seen were recurrent skin abscesses, chronic cryptosporidial diarrhea, meningococcal meningitis with recurrent herpes simplex, and fatal klebsiella lobar pneumonia. Both sexes were affected, and the ages of the patients ranged from 15 to 56 years.

{1:Bax et al. (1999)} reported the case of an 18-year-old man with meningococcal meningitis and low serum concentrations of MBL. His mother and grandfather, who had also had meningitis in early adulthood, likewise had low concentrations of MBL in their serum.

The low levels of mannose-binding lectin in young children with recurrent infections ({15:Summerfield et al., 1997}) suggest that the mannose-binding lectin pathway is important during the interval between the loss of passively acquired maternal antibody and the acquisition of a mature immunologic repertoire. There is a high frequency of dominantly expressed alleles of the gene for mannose-binding lectin that result in low levels of the protein in several ethnic groups. {19:Walport (2001)}, among others, suggested that this deficiency during early childhood is counterbalanced by an advantage later in life. It is possible that the opsonization of intracellular organisms such as mycobacteria by mannose-binding lectin enhances the entry of such pathogens into cells. Low levels of mannose-binding lectin, by reducing opsonization, may confer resistance against mycobacteria.

In a prospective study of 848 patients with community-acquired pneumonia, 1,447 healthy control individuals, and a control group of 519 patients without relevant infectious diseases, {5:Garcia-Laorden et al.

Six additional families, all of Turkish descent, were subsequently found to have a similar disorder. Affected individuals had variable sleep disturbances, including late onset of sleep and fragmented sleep patterns.

Inter- and intrafamilial variability has been observed ({63:Timberlake et al., 2021}).

Hemifacial microsomia is a common birth defect involving the first and second branchial arch derivatives. It typically affects the external ear, middle ear, mandible and temporomandibular joint, muscles of mastication and facial muscles, and other facial soft tissues on the affected side. In some cases, other facial structures, such as the orbit, eye, nose, cranium, or neck, may be involved. Involvement is usually limited to one side, but bilateral involvement is known. In addition to craniofacial anomalies, there may be cardiac, vertebral, and central nervous system defects. The phenotype is highly variable. Most cases are sporadic, but there are rare familial cases that exhibit autosomal dominant inheritance (summary by {41:Poole, 1989} and {21:Hennekam et al., 2010}).

<Subhead> Genetic Heterogeneity of Craniofacial Microsomia

CFM2 ({620444}) is caused by mutation in the FOXI3 gene ({612351}) on chromosome 2p11.

See also hemifacial microsomia with radial defects ({141400}) and oculoauriculofrontonasal dysplasia (OAFNS; {601452}), which may be part of the OAV spectrum.

Another disorder that overlaps clinically with CFM is Townes-Brocks syndrome (TBS; {107480}).

{47:Ronde et al. (2023)} reviewed the international classification and clinical management strategies for craniofacial microsomia and microtia, and tabulated survey responses from 57 professionals involved in management of CFM patients. The authors noted that although the International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement (ICHOM) criteria for CFM exclude isolated microtia from the phenotypic spectrum of CFM, the question of whether isolated microtia can be considered the mildest form of CFM is debated in the literature. No consensus was reached in their survey, as a majority of respondents agreed with the ICHOM criteria but also considered isolated microtia to be a mild form of CFM. In addition, the authors noted that although vertebral, cardiac, and renal anomalies have been reported in CFM patients, there was no consensus on screening for such extracraniofacial anomalies.","The features of hemifacial microsomia include unilateral deformity of the external ear and small ipsilateral half of the face with epibulbar dermoid and vertebral anomalies. Coloboma of the upper eyelid is frequent. The ear deformities range from preauricular tags of cartilaginous masses, to atresia of the external auditory canal, anomalies in the size and shape of the external auricle, and even to anotia. {20:Gorlin et al. (1963)} suggested the designation oculoauriculovertebral dysplasia for this disorder.

{49:Saraux et al. (1963)} described 2 sisters with Goldenhar syndrome, born of healthy, unrelated parents. The karyotype was normal. {42:Proto and Scullica (1966)} described the condition in a father and his son and daughter. The mother was a first cousin of the father. A patient who possibly had the same condition was observed by {15:Fraser (1967)} to have acroosteolysis of the terminal phalanges. {31:Krause (1970)} described affected brother and sister. The proband had a hemangioma of the scalp. {46:Rollnick and Kaye (1983)} studied the families of 97 probands. Of 433 first-degree relatives, 35 (8%) had the same or a similar anomaly. Of 176 sibs, 11 (6%) were 'affected.' The most frequent anomaly was a mild ear malformation such as preauricular nodule or tag. Multifactorial determination was proposed. {45:Rollnick et al. (1987)} reviewed phenotypic characteristics of 294 patients.

{36:Morrison et al. (1992)} reviewed the cardiovascular anomalies associated with OAV dysplasia.

{51:Singer et al. (1994)} described a large Australian family in which 9 members over 2 generations had hemifacial microsomia. The affected individuals exhibited marked variation in their clinical manifestation of HFM and associated anomalies, with some having such mild involvement that they were previously undiagnosed. Features ranged from isolated microtia, which was the most consistent finding, to severe HFM characterized by microtia, preauricular skin tags, macrostomia, and ipsilateral ramus and condylar hypoplasia with associated soft tissue deficiency. Most patients had unilateral involvement, with the right side more commonly affected that the left, but 2 had bilateral lesions. The authors noted that the extreme phenotypic variability displayed in this family was in keeping with previous reports in the literature. Epibulbar dermoid was present in 1 patient, consistent with an earlier suggestion that HFM and Goldenhar syndrome are part of a spectrum rather than distinct clinical entities.

{59:Sutphen et al. (1995)} found that 3 of 60 patients with the oculoauriculovertebral spectrum (OAVS) had tracheoesophageal fistula, with or without esophageal atresia.

{55:Stoll et al. (1998)} described a mother and 2 of her children who had the oculoauriculovertebral spectrum. The mother had only auricular anomalies for which she had had plastic and reconstructive surgery. Her first child, a girl, had a bilateral cleft lip and palate, a coloboma of the upper eyelid, facial asymmetry, and posteriorly angulated ears. This child also had bilateral vesicoureteral reflux. During the second pregnancy, her fetal ultrasonographic examination performed at 18 weeks' gestation showed a cleft lip and palate. At 31 weeks' gestation, clubfeet, hypoplasia of the left ear, hypoplasia of the left maxillary and mandibular arches, and left microphthalmia were evident. Examination of the male fetus after termination of the pregnancy confirmed the findings of ultrasonography and demonstrated vertebral anomalies.

{65:Van Meter and Weaver (1996)} reported 2 infants (a male and a female) with significant overlap of symptoms of oculoauriculovertebral spectrum and CHARGE association ({214800}). In addition, both infants had plagiocephaly and torticollis, and the boy had cleft lip, heminostril, and tracheoesophageal fistula. The authors suggested that deficiency in migration of neural crest cells, deficiency of mesodermal formation, or defective interaction between neural crest cells and mesoderm may explain the pathogenesis of these defects of blastogenesis.

{39:Nijhawan et al. (2002)} reported 7 children with Goldenhar syndrome who were found to have dysplastic, ectopic, or bilobed caruncles, a small body at the medial angle of the eye that contains modified sebaceous and sweat glands. Four of the children had a nasal sinus or tag and 1 had a nasal-ocular cleft, suggesting an abnormality in the developmental process that is common to the nose and caruncle.

By study of a series of 30 cases (26 previously reported) and by analysis of a congenital birth defects registry in Spain, {66:Wang et al. (2002)} found that infants of diabetic mothers were at increased risk for a diagnosis of OAVS. Analysis of the registry data gave an odds ratio of OAVS of 2.28 (95% CI, 1.03-4.82; p = 0.03) and 1.50 (95% CI, 0.08-9.99; p = 0.49) in maternal gestational diabetes and preconceptually diagnosed type I or II maternal diabetes, respectively. {66:Wang et al. (2002)} hypothesized that poorly controlled maternal diabetes interferes with neural crest cell migration.

{11:Derbent et al. (2003)} described a child with del22q11 who had a phenotypic appearance similar to that seen in OAVS. He had left microtia with atresia of the external meatus, left mandibular hypoplasia, and peripheral facial nerve paralysis. Growth parameters were below the 5th percentile, but intelligence and ophthalmologic examination were normal. Cardiac findings included situs inversus dextrocardia, double outlet right ventricle, pulmonic stenosis, and ventricular septal defect. Radiographs showed platybasia, complete fusion of the C2-C3, and posterior fusion of the T1-T2 vertebrae.

{3:Beck et al. (2005)} described 2 unrelated girls with OAVS and ocular colobomas. One girl had bilateral iris colobomas extending into the retina and a small left optic nerve coloboma; her mother had features consistent with OAVS and a segmental area of heterochromia of her right iris. The second girl had a large left inferior chorioretinal coloboma involving her optic nerve and macula as well as a left colobomatous cyst; her sister and father had features consistent with OAVS, although neither had ocular colobomas.

{64:Touliatou et al. (2006)} reported detailed clinical features of 17 Greek patients with Goldenhar syndrome, including a pair of affected monozygotic twins. The most consistent findings were auricular defects (94%), followed by facial anomalies (76%), ocular anomalies (65%), and conductive hearing loss (76%). Most features were unilateral (70%); mandibular hypoplasia was ipsilateral to the dysplastic ear in 9 of 10 patients. Facial nerve paralysis and mental retardation were also observed.

{56:Stromland et al. (2007)} performed a multidisciplinary study of 18 Swedish patients with Goldenhar syndrome and found that the most frequent systemic malformations involved the ears (100%), eyes (72%), vertebrae (76%), cerebrum (50%), and heart (33%). Functional defects consisted of hearing impairment (83%; including conductive loss, sensorineural, or combined), visual impairment (28%), both visual and hearing impairment (28%), difficulties in feeding/eating (50%), speech impairment (53%), and mental retardation (39%). Two of 17 patients evaluated for autistic spectrum disorder had severe autistic symptoms (11%).

{70:Yusufoglu et al. (2008)} reported an 8-year-old boy with facial, auricular, and vertebral anomalies consistent with Goldenhar syndrome, who had a parachute mitral valve and was also found to have growth hormone deficiency. The authors noted that 1 other patient with Goldenhar syndrome had been reported with growth hormone deficiency ({37:Nakagawa et al., 1993}), but stated that it was not clear whether this was an association by chance or a rare finding in the syndrome.

{2:Amalnath et al. (2008)} reported 3 brothers with OAVS manifest as bilateral lower facial palsies, bilateral microtia with aural atresia, and kyphoscoliosis. Radiographs showed fused cervical vertebrae and spina bifida occulta of multiple lumbar vertebrae in all 3 sibs. CT scan of the temporal bone revealed temporal bone dysplasia, absent styloid process, and intact ear ossicles. There were no cardiac or renal anomalies. One of the boys developed a B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma at age 13 years. Inheritance was consistent with an autosomal recessive or X-linked pattern.

{13:Digilio et al. (2008)} analyzed the frequency and anatomic characteristics of congenital heart defects (CHDs) in a series of 87 patients with OAVS who were examined during a 17-year period at a single center. CHDs were diagnosed in 28 (32%) of the patients. The most common CHDs were membranous or muscular ventricular septal defect (6 patients) and tetralogy of Fallot, either classic or with pulmonary atresia (6 patients). Three patients had atrial septal defect. In addition, anomalous pulmonary venous return was diagnosed in 4 patients, which was partial in 3 and total in 1. Although there is a greater frequency of male patients with OAVS, there was no sex preponderance among OAVS patients with CHDs.

{52:Slavotinek and Vargervik (2011)} reported a 10-year-old Hispanic boy who had features of OAVS, including facial asymmetry, lipodermoids, smaller right ear with preauricular tags and a cheek tag, small jaw with defective oral commissure, and vertebral anomalies, but who also displayed several atypical findings, including an imperforate anus, rib fusions, and scoliosis requiring a brace. He was born of a twin pregnancy with dichorionic, diamniotic membranes; his twin brother had developmental delay, unilateral mild to moderate conductive hearing loss, mild hypotonia, and bilateral fifth finger clinodactyly. Chromosome microarray showed no diagnostic cytogenetic aberrations, and screening of the SALL1 gene was negative in the proband.

{63:Timberlake et al. (2021)} studied 20 patients from 7 kindreds with craniofacial microsomia and mutation in the SF3B2 gene, including the large Australian family originally described by {51:Singer et al. (1994)}. Features included mandibular hypoplasia, microtia, facial and preauricular tags, epibulbar dermoids, and lateral oral clefts. Widely variable phenotypes were observed within single kindreds, supporting the notion that microtia and CFM are part of a single phenotypic spectrum. Cervical ribs were detected in 3 patients; the authors stated that cervical imaging was not available for the other patients, and thus the exact frequency in the cohort was unknown. Noting that consistent features included mandibular hypoplasia and external ear malformations involving the tragus, the authors suggested that the SF3B2 variants predominantly affect development of pharyngeal arch I.

About 80% of patients had a slightly later onset (median age 17 years, range 5 to 60) of multifocal proximal predominant myoclonus mainly of the upper limbs. The severity ranged from asymptomatic focal jerks to generalized myoclonus causing falls or drop attacks. Tremor and myoclonus were exacerbated by photic induction, stress, tactile stimulus, sleep deprivation, and hunger. Eight (15%) individuals also had later onset of generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and a few had focal seizures. The disorder was slowly progressive. EEG of 36 individuals showed abnormalities only in 2, who showed sharp or polyspike wave discharges.

Some patients are asymptomatic and never diagnosed. The most common presenting symptom is the sudden onset of focal sensory loss and muscle weakness in the distribution of a single nerve. In many cases, these acute focal symptoms are triggered by mechanical stresses to the nerve, such as compression, repetitive movement or stretching of the affected limbs. Commonly affected nerves include the peroneal nerve at the fibular head, ulnar nerve at the elbow, median nerve at the wrist, brachial plexus and radial nerve. Clinical manifestations caused by these mononeuropathies include foot drop, hand numbness and weakness, arm weakness, and sensory loss over the index finger and thumb or lateral aspect of the hand. In 50% of cases, patients recover from these episodes within a few days to months but others have incomplete recovery and suffer from recurrent focal sensory and motor deficits. In rare cases, brachial plexopathy with unilateral painless arm paralysis and sensory loss may be a presenting symptom. Occasionally, mild impairments of cranial nerve functions may be seen. Absent deep tendon reflexes and pes cavus foot deformity are seen in some patients but not in others.

Others do not show any sunburn reaction and gradually develop marked freckling at sun exposed sites. Individuals have dry skin and hypo- or hyperpigmented lesions. There is a greater than 10,000-fold increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancers, and a 2,000 fold increased risk of melanoma under the age of 20 when compared to the general population. Patients with classical XP develop skin cancer generally before the age of 20, while patients with XP variant start to develop skin cancer at about 20-30 years of age. Ocular abnormalities include keratitis resulting in corneal opacification and vascularization. Photophobia is common. Ocular squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma are common. Neurologic abnormalities of varying severity have been reported in about 30% of cases. These include acquired microcephaly, diminished or absent deep tendon stretch reflexes, progressive sensorineural hearing loss, spasticity, ataxia, seizures and progressive cognitive impairment. De Sanctis-Cacchione syndrome is a term that was originally attributed to XP cases with severe neurological abnormalities but it is no longer in general use.",0.61,0.63,['Orphanet: Xeroderma pigmentosum'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
