Methods: The clinical data of 9 children with SGCE-related myoclonus dystonia syndrome admitted at either the Department of Neurology, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University or the Department of Pediatrics, Peking University First Hospital from May 2018 to October 2019 were collected and the patients were followed up. The definite diagnosis was made on the basis of whole exome sequencing and multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification. The clinical features and gene test results were analyzed retrospectively. Results: Data of 9 patients (4 boys and 5 girls) diagnosed as myoclonus dystonia syndrome caused by SGCE variants were collected. The onset age ranged from 1 year to 3 years and 2 months. The first symptom was myoclonus in 4 cases, while dystonia in the remaining 5 cases. In the course of the disease, 9 cases had myoclonus and 8 had dystonia. Myoclonic jerks were characterized by involuntary jerks in both upper limbs in 8 patients. Six patients had involuntary jerks of lower limbs, resulting in gait instability or even falling. The myoclonus was exacerbated during the fine motor activities, emotional stress or fatigue. Dystonia was characterized by abnormal gait, including 5 cases with right leg dystonia, and 3 cases with the left leg dystonia. Three probands had a positive family history. Intellectual development was normal in all cases. There was no obvious abnormality in video-electroencephalogram (EEG) during both ictal and interictal periods. Electromyography (EMG) and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of 9 patients were normal. Nine patients carried SGCE gene variants, including 3 frame shift variants, 2 nonsense variants, 2 missense variants, 1 fragment deletion variant and 1 splice site variant. Seven variants were inherited paternally, and 2 variants were de novo. Madopar was used in 8 patients, and nitrazepam in 4 patients, leading to the decrease in the myoclonus jerks and improvement of gait in 6 and 2 patients, respectively. Conclusions: SGCE gene variants can cause myoclonus dystonia syndrome. The onset of the disease may occur at infancy or preschool age, with either myoclonic jerks or dystonia as the initial symptom. Non-epileptic myoclonus is the prominent symptom, with upper limb mainly involved. Most of the patients have the accompanying symptoms of dystonia, and some of them may have spontaneous symptom relief. SGCE gene is imprinted maternally, and the inherited variants of SGCE are paternal in origin.""","""2020""","[""myoclonus dystonia syndrome"", ""non-epileptic myoclonus"", ""myoclonus jerks"", ""nitrazepam"", ""madopar"", ""leg dystonia"", ""abnormal gait"", ""fatigue"", ""gait instability"", ""involuntary jerks"", ""myoclonic jerks"", ""dystonia"", ""myoclonus"", ""patients"", ""sgce""]"

DYT1 on chromosome 9q34 was the first PTD gene to be mapped. A 3-bp (GAG) deletion in this gene was reported to account for almost all early limb-onset generalized PTD. No relationship has been found with DYT1 in patients with prominent craniocervical involvement. To elucidate the DYT1-associated phenotype, we analysed the DYT1 mutation in 150 PTD patients, either sporadic or index cases from small PTD families. Twenty-two patients were positive for the GAG deletion in the DYT1 gene. Fifteen of them presented with the typical DYT1 phenotype (early, limb-onset generalized dystonia without spread to craniocervical muscles), four had limb-onset dystonia with spread to craniocervical muscles, two patients had arm-onset segmental dystonia and one had focal right-arm dystonia. One-hundred and twenty-eight patients were negative for the DYT1 mutation. Forty-six of them had segmental dystonia and 59 had focal dystonia. The other 23 patients presented with generalized dystonia, either with craniocervical involvement (13 patients) or without spread to the craniocervical region (typical DYT1 phenotype-10 patients).

"""10073176""","""[Genetic dystonia].""","""A NEW CLASSIFICATION: The advent of molecular genetics has led to a total revision of earlier classifications of primary dystonias. LOCUS DYT-1 PRIMARY DYSTONIA: Locus DYT1, situated on chromosome 9, is responsible for the most common phenotypic expression of generalized primary dystonia, Ziehen-Oppenheim disease. This autosomal dominant disease has variable penetration. It has long been recognized that some individuals in families with typical disease only have segmentary, multifocal or even focal dystonia. It has been proven by molecular genetics that the disease can be expressed simply by familial writers cramp with particularly early, and often bilateral, onset. The mutation concerns the torsine A gene, whose function remains to be elucidated. Torsine A is found in the central nervous system, particularly in the dopaminergic neurons of the locus niger. GENERALIZED PRIMARY DYSTONIA UNRELATED TO DYT-1: These dystonias are phenotypically different: younger and more variable age at onset, focal localization early in the disease course generally involving the cervical or cephalic pole, less severe course. Certain forms are linked to chromosome 8 (locus DYT 6). PRIMARY FOCAL OR SEGMENTARY DYSTONIAS: These primary dystonias cause functional or postural disorders and were long considered as sporadic despite rare familial cases suggesting a genetic factor. When searched for systematically, familial cases are found in 20 to 30% of the cases. The dystonia is transmitted by dominant autosomal heredity with reduced penetration. Phenotypically, expression is heterogeneous with a constant frequency of unrecognized or neglected forms and of postural forms. One form is known to be linked to chromosome 18 (locus DYT 7). DOPA-RESPONSIVE DYSTONIA: This class represents 5 to 10% of childhood dystonias. The phenotypic expression is polymorphous but symptoms always improve with very small doses of L-dopa. Both sporadic, and more frequently familial, cases are described. Some forms are recessive, caused by mutation of the gene coding for tyrosine hydroxylase, others are autosomal dominant, often linked to mutation of the gene coding for GTP cyclohydrolase.

The discovery that an expanded trinucleotide DNA repeat was central to the mechanism of this disease has been repeated over and over in a growing list of inherited ataxias. In 1997, a different mutation and genetic mechanism was discovered in a severe type of generalized primary torsion dystonia - Oppenheim's dystonia. Before this, only the genetic cause for rare metabolic dystonias was known, notably dopa-responsive (Segawa's) dystonia. In the same year, from the identification of mutation in the alpha-synuclein gene in rare pedigrees with autosomal dominant parkinsonism, arose the concept that Parkinson's disease may be part of a broader group of 'synucleinopathies', in which there is a fundamental defect in protein processing. In the following year, mutations in autosomal recessive juvenile onset parkinsonism were found in a gene called 'parkin'. Parkin mutations are a more common cause of parkinsonism than the rare alpha-synuclein mutations, particularly in young-onset disease. However, a most important understanding, occurring in the last year, has been the relationship between the parkin gene product, alpha-synuclein and abnormal protein degradation in the cell. A unified theory of neuronal death in Parkinson's disease is emerging, pointing to potential new therapies in the future.""","""2001""","[""movement disorders"", ""neuronal death"", ""parkinsonism"", ""parkin"", ""autosomal recessive juvenile onset parkinsonism"", ""synucleinopathies"", ""parkinson's disease"", ""autosomal dominant parkinsonism"", ""alpha-synuclein"", ""dopa-responsive (segawa's) dystonia"", ""metabolic dystonias"", ""oppenheim's dystonia"", ""primary torsion dystonia"", ""inherited ataxias"", ""chromosome 4""]"
"""12518301""","""Secondary cervical dystonia associated with structural lesions of the central nervous system.""","""We tested the hypothesis that structural lesions of the central nervous system (CNS) associated with cervical dystonia more commonly involve the cerebellum and its primary afferent pathways than basal ganglia structures. Cervical dystonia is the most common focal dystonia, the majority of cases are idiopathic, and only a small percentage of patients have a family history of dystonia or other movement disorders. Pathophysiological mechanisms operative in solely or predominantly appendicular dystonias such as writer's cramp and Oppenheim's dystonia, respectively, may not be directly applicable to axial dystonias. The localization of structural lesions of the CNS associated with secondary cervical dystonia may provide some insight into the neural structures potentially involved in primary cervical dystonia. The National Library of Medicine Gateway (from 1960) and a clinical database maintained by the senior author (from 1999) were searched for cases of secondary cervical dystonia associated with structural lesions of the CNS. Search terms included one or more of the following: dystonia, torticollis, cervical, secondary, and symptomatic. Lesion localization and type, patient age, patient gender, head position, occurrence of sensory tricks, and associated neurological findings were tabulated for each case. Structural lesions associated with cervical dystonia were most commonly localized to the brainstem and cerebellum. The remaining cases were equally divided between the cervical spinal cord and basal ganglia. Although inconsistent, head rotation tended to be contralateral to lesion localization. Additional neurological abnormalities were present in the majority of patients with secondary cervical dystonia. The relative paucity of basal ganglia pathology and concentration of lesions in the brainstem, cerebellum, and cervical spinal cord in patients with secondary cervical dystonia suggests that dysfunction of cerebellar afferent pathways may be important to the pathophysiology of primary cervical dystonia.""","""2003""","[""neurological abnormalities"", ""head rotation"", ""patient"", ""torticollis"", ""primary cervical dystonia"", ""axial dystonias"", ""oppenheim's dystonia"", ""writer's cramp"", ""dystonias"", ""movement disorders"", ""patients"", ""dystonia"", ""cervical dystonia""]"

The results are briefly compared with those reported for DBS in DYT1 dystonia (Oppenheim dystonia), which is caused by the DYT1 gene. METHODS: Enrollment in this prospective expanded pilot study was limited to adult patients with severely disabling, medically refractory non-DYT1 generalized dystonia or choreoathetosis. Six consecutive patients underwent follow-up examinations at defined intervals of 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years postsurgery. There were five women and one man, and their mean age at surgery was 45.5 years. Formal assessments included both the Burke-Fahn-Marsden dystonia scale and the recently developed Unified Dystonia Rating Scale. Two patients had primary generalized non-DYT1 dystonia, and four suffered from choreoathetosis secondary to infantile cerebral palsy. Bilateral quadripolar DBS electrodes were implanted in all instances, except in one patient with markedly asymmetrical symptoms. There were no adverse events related to surgery. The Burke-Fahn-Marsden scores in the two patients with generalized dystonia improved by 78 and 71% at 3 months, by 82 and 69% at 1 year, and by 78 and 70% at 2 years postoperatively. This was paralleled by marked amelioration of disability scores. The mean improvement in Burke-Fahn-Marsden scores in patients with choreoathetosis was 12% at 3 months, 29% at 1 year, and 23% at 2 years postoperatively, which was not significant. Two of these patients thought that they had achieved marked improvement at 2 years postoperatively, although results of objective evaluations were less impressive. In these two patients there was a minor but stable improvement in disability scores. All patients had an improvement in pain scores at the 2-year follow-up review. Medication was tapered off in both patients with generalized dystonia and reduced in two of the patients with choreoathetosis. All stimulation-induced side effects were reversible on adjustment of the DBS settings. Energy consumption of the batteries was considerably higher than in patients with Parkinson disease. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic pallidal DBS is a safe and effective procedure in generalized non-DYT1 dystonia, and it may become the procedure of choice in patients with medically refractory dystonia. Postoperative improvement of choreoathetosis is more modest and varied, and subjective ratings of outcome may exceed objective evaluations.""","""2003""","[""parkinson disease"", ""pain"", ""patient"", ""infantile cerebral palsy"", ""man"", ""women"", ""oppenheim dystonia"", ""patients"", ""choreoathetosis"", ""dystonia"", ""dyt1""]"

The same gene may be responsible for ITD both in the non-Jewish kindred mentioned above and in the Ashkenazi Jewish families presented here.

Acute dystonic reactions were produced in rats with unilateral microinjection of haloperidol into the red nucleus as previously described. Similar to the pattern in humans, this effect could be attenuated by coadministration of diphenhydramine. Unilateral microinjection of histamine itself into the rat red nucleus produced dystonic postures (torticollis) in a dose-dependent manner, demonstrating that a histamine dysfunction could contribute to the pathophysiology of dystonia. The torticollis produced by histamine could be significantly attenuated with coadministration of the H1 antagonists diphenhydramine or pyrilamine or the H2 antagonist cimetidine. These effects are thought to be mediated through the red nucleus because significantly more torticollis was observed when histamine was injected into the red nucleus rather than surrounding mid-brain areas, the substantia nigra, or the lateral ventricle.

Since dystonic attacks occur in the absence of any lesion which can be defined by standard histopathological techniques in the central nervous system, the presumption is that dystonia in mutant hamsters is due to some biochemical disturbance activity in brain regions involved in motor functions. In the present study we determined the monoamine neurotransmitters dopamine, noradrenaline, adrenaline and serotonin (5-HT) as well as the dopamine metabolites homovanillic acid (HVA) and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and the 5-HT metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in 14 brain regions of male and female dystonic hamsters and age-matched non-dystonic controls. All determinations were done at age of maximum susceptibility for induction of dystonic attacks. Since both genders of dystonic hamsters exhibit the same characteristic age-dependent time-course of dystonia, it was assumed that only those biochemical alterations are critically involved in dystonia that occur in both female and male animals. The neurochemical data show that except for a significant decrease of dopamine and HVA in the olfactory bulb, no consistent changes in dopamine metabolism are present across brain regions, including the basal ganglia, of dystonic hamsters. In contrast, marked increases in noradrenaline and 5-HT or 5-HIAA were found in several brain areas of both genders, indicating an enhanced activity of central noradrenergic and serotonergic nuclei in the brainstem.

Burke et al. described a different category of secondary dystonia, where perinatal injury (asphyxia) caused minimal or no immediate neurological deficit, with the delay of years before dystonia emerged. This type of dystonia following perinatal injury has been termed \""delayed onset dystonia due to static encephalopathy of childhood\"". According to the definition of dystonia, we were able to select 5 patients with the aetiologic diagnosis of perinatal asphyxia from the group of 347 out- and inpatients (1.4%) treated for various types of dystonia at the Movement Disorders Department (Institute of Neurology, CCS, Belgrade) from November 1986 to November 1994. At onset of dystonia the mean age of patients was 13.2 years (range from 10 to 17), with combined initial involvement of the arm and neck in 3 patients. The period from the onset of the disease to the maximum severity lasted 8.2 years (range from 4 to 14), resulting in segmental brachial dystonia in 3, hemidystonia and generalized dystonia in one patient each (Table 1). The adverse perinatal events are described in Table 2. Three of our patients had delayed achievements of developmental milestones. All patients were regularly schooled and had preserved intellectual capacities, except the patient 3 whose achievements were below average (IQ = 86). Different drugs were administered (Table 3), but moderate effects were achieved only with trihexyphenidyl in two patients (daily doses of 24 mg and 30 mg, respectively), and baclofen (80 mg p.d.) in one patient. In this study we describe 5 new patients who fulfilled the criteria for the diagnosis of delayed-onset dystonia due to perinatal asphyxia (Tables 1 and 2). We accepted the approach of Saint-Hilaire et al. to suggest a relationship between perinatal asphyxia and later occurrence of dystonia in our 5 patients. However, coincident occurrence of a primary dystonia with a static encephalopathy of childhood due to perinatal asphyxia cannot be excluded. This phenomenon of delayed appearance of dystonia was also described in other forms of static cerebral injury; i.e. stroke, head trauma or anoxic brain damage. Interestingly enough, age at the time of anoxia or brain insults seemed to be crucial for the development of dystonia: those who suffer acute brain insults during childhood or early life are more likely to develop dystonia than the older patients. Therefore, the \""static\"" nature of encephalopathy induced by perinatal asphyxia is questionable. Finally, this study strengthens the suggestion that perinatal asphyxia can lead to delayed-onset dystonia, and, since \""some of these patients closely resemble cases of idiopathic torsion dystonia, the prior occurrence of asphyxia should be used as a criterion of exclusion for that diagnosis\"".""","""1997""",[]

We have now examined activation of the motor system in healthy control subjects and patients with writer's cramp while they write a stereotyped word repetitively at a paced rate before and after treatment with botulinum toxin to see if these patients showed a similar pattern of abnormalities and whether they were reversible. As in ITD, our patients with writer's cramp showed impaired activation of the contralateral primary motor cortex, but enhanced activation of frontal association cortex. Botulinum-toxin treatment improved writing and increased activation in parietal cortex and caudal SMA. This may represent either a change in movement strategy or associated cortical reorganization secondary to deefferentation of alpha motor neurons. However, botulinum toxin failed to improve the impaired activation of the primary motor cortex.

These involuntary movements when occur in the childhood show the specific ages of onset and the courses. For example postural dystonia occurs in childhood but action dystonia tend to occur in later ages. Postural tremor occurs after the second decades but resting tremor does not occur in childhood. Furthermore drug induced dystonia but not levodopa induced dyskinesia occurs in childhood. The age dependent clinical features observed in these involuntary movements are thought to be due to the specific developmental processes of the pathway in the basal ganglia and its efferent projections, which are involved in the pathophysiology in the each disorder. For example, the dopamine activity is known to be increased in the striatum before ten years of age which decreases, rapidly during the first decade and further decreases in the next decade with the moderate degree till adult level. The direct pathway, which is predominant in the ventral area in the basal ganglia, matures earlier than the indirect pathway, which is predominant in the dorsal area. In this paper the pathophysiologies of the hereditary progressive dystonia with marked diurnal fluctuation, juvenile parkinsonism, idiopathic torsion dystonia, chorea, ballismus and tics, all of which occur in the childhood, are discussed from the view point of the age dependent specificities of the involved pathways in the basal ganglia and their projections during development.""","""1997""",[]

Estimates based on intra-allelic variation follow from the exponential decay of linkage disequilibrium because of recombination and mutation. The confidence interval depends both on the uncertainty in recombination and mutation rates and on randomness of the genealogy of chromosomes that carry the allele (the intra-allelic genealogy). Several approximate methods to account for variation in the intra-allelic genealogy have been derived. Allele frequency alone also provides an estimate of age. Estimates based on frequency and on intra-allelic variability can be combined to provide a more accurate estimate or can be contrasted to show that an allele has been subject to natural selection.

The allelic association between this extended haplotype and DYT1 predicts that these three genes lie within 1-2 cM of each other; on the basis of obligate recombination events, the DYT1 gene is centromeric to ASS. Furthermore, this allelic association supports the idea that a single mutation event is responsible for most hereditary cases of dystonia in the Jewish population. Of the 53 definitely affected typed, 13 appear to be sporadic, with no family history of dystonia. However, the proportion of sporadic cases which potentially carry the A12 haplotype at ASS (8/13 [62%]) is similar to the proportion of familial cases with A12 (28/40 [70%]). This suggests that many sporadic cases are hereditary, that the disease gene frequency is greater than 1/15,000, and that the penetrance is lower than 30%, as previously estimated in this population. Most affected individuals were heterozygous for the ABL-ASS haplotype, a finding supporting autosomal dominant inheritance of the DYT1 gene.

This abnormal pattern was characterized by increased metabolic activity in the lentiform nuclei, cerebellum, and supplementary motor areas. The MF pattern was present in DYT1 carriers with and without clinical manifestations and persisted in DYT1 dystonia patients in whom involuntary movements were suppressed by sleep. The second pattern, identified in an analysis of affected gene carriers with sustained contractions at rest, was designated movement related (MR).

Relatively little is understood about the normal function of torsinA or the physiological effects of the codon deletion associated with most cases of disease. Overexpression of wild-type torsinA in cultured cells by DNA transfection results in a reticular distribution of immunoreactive protein that co-localizes with endoplasmic reticulum resident chaperones, while the dystonia-related mutant form accumulates within concentric membrane whorls and nuclear-associated membrane stacks. In this study we examined the biogenesis of mutant torsinA-positive membrane inclusions using tetracycline-regulated herpes simplex virus amplicon vectors. At low expression levels, mutant torsinA was localized predominantly around the nucleus, while at high levels it was also concentrated within cytosolic spheroid inclusions. In contrast, the distribution of wild-type torsinA did not vary, appearing diffuse and reticular at all expression levels. These observations are consistent with descriptions of inducible membrane synthesis in other systems in which cytosolic membrane whorls are derived from multilayered membrane stacks that first form around the nuclear envelope. These results also suggest that formation of mutant torsinA-positive inclusions occurs at high expression levels in culture, whereas the perinuclear accumulation of the mutant protein is present even at low expression levels that are more likely to resemble those of the endogenous protein.

In this study, the intracellular localization and levels of endogenous torsin were evaluated in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells following differentiation and stress. TorsinA, apparent MW 37 kDa, cofractionates with markers for the microsomal/endoplasmic reticulum (ER) compartment and appears to reside primarily within the ER lumen based on protease resistance. TorsinA immunoreactivity colocalizes with the lumenal ER protein protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) and extends throughout neurites. Levels of torsinA did not increase notably in response to nerve growth factor-induced differentiation. None of the stress conditions tested, including heat shock and the unfolded protein response, affected torsinA, except for oxidative stress, which resulted in an increase in the apparent MW of torsinA and redistribution to protrusions from the cell surface. These findings are consistent with a relatively rapid covalent modification of torsinA in response to oxidative stress causing a change in state.

Human torsinA, mutations in which cause another movement disorder termed early-onset torsion dystonia, is highly expressed in DA neurons and is also a component of Lewy bodies.

Thus, we examined the ability of torsinA to manage cellular stress within DA neurons of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Worm DA neurons undergo a reproducible pattern of neurodegeneration after treatment with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), a neurotoxin commonly used to model PD. Overexpression of torsins in C. elegans DA neurons results in dramatic suppression of neurodegeneration after 6-OHDA treatment. In contrast, expression of either dystonia-associated mutant torsinA or combined overexpression of wild-type and mutant torsinA yielded greatly diminished neuroprotection against 6-OHDA. We further demonstrated that torsins seem to protect DA neurons from 6-OHDA through downregulating protein levels of the dopamine transporter (DAT-1) in vivo. Additionally, we determined that torsins protect robustly against DA neurodegeneration caused by overexpression of alpha-synuclein. Using mutant nematodes lacking DAT-1 function, we also showed that torsin neuroprotection from alpha-synuclein-induced degeneration occurs in a manner independent of this transporter.

To gain insight into how these sequence variations affect torsinA, we used the structure of the related protein ClpB to provide a model of torsinA's AAA+ domain. Motifs important for ATP hydrolysis-sensor 1 and sensor 2-were identified, mutagenized and used to validate predictions of this model. Inspection revealed that the DeltaGAG deletion associated with dystonia removes one residue from an alpha-helix in the C-terminal portion of the AAA+ domain. The resulting distortion in torsinA structure may underlie this mutant's known tendency to produce ER-derived inclusions as well as its proposed loss of function. The D/H polymorphism at residue 216 falls in the N-terminal portion of the AAA+ domain near the sensor 1 motif. Surprisingly, cells expressing torsinA with the polymorphic histidine developed inclusions similar to those associated with DeltaGAG-torsinA, indicating that this change may also affect torsinA structure. Introducing H216 into DeltaGAG-torsinA reduced its tendency to form inclusions, suggesting that the two changes offset each other. Our findings point to a structural basis for the defects associated with the disease-linked DeltaGAG deletion in torsinA.

We investigated an association between torsinA and nesprin-3, which spans the outer nuclear membrane (ONM) of the NE and links it to vimentin via plectin in fibroblasts. Mouse nesprin-3alpha co-immunoprecipitated with torsinA and this involved the C-terminal region of torsinA and the KASH domain of nesprin-3alpha. This association with human nesprin-3 appeared to be stronger for torsinADeltaE than for torsinA. TorsinA also associated with the KASH domains of nesprin-1 and -2 (SYNE1 and 2), which link to actin. In the absence of torsinA, in knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), nesprin-3alpha was localized predominantly in the ER. Enrichment of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-nesprin-3 in the ER was also seen in the fibroblasts of DYT1 patients, with formation of YFP-positive globular structures enriched in torsinA, vimentin and actin. TorsinA-null MEFs had normal NE structure, but nuclear polarization and cell migration were delayed in a wound-healing assay, as compared with wild-type MEFs.

Systemic administration of amphetamine did not increase dopamine (DA) release as efficiently in these mice as compared with wild-type transgenic and non-transgenic mice. We, now, studied the contribution of the DA transporter (DAT) to amphetamine-induced DA release in hMT1 transgenic mice using in vivo no-net flux microdialysis. This method applies different concentrations of DA through the microdialysis probe and measures DA concentration at the output of the probe following an equilibrium period. The slope (extraction fraction) is the measure of the DAT activity in vivo. The slope for hMT1 transgenic mice was 0.58 +/- 0.07 and for non-transgenic animals, 0.87 +/- 0.06 (p < 0.05). We further investigated the efficacy of nomifensine (a specific DAT inhibitor) in inhibiting amphetamine-induced DA release. Local application of nomifensine 80 min before the systemic application of amphetamine inhibited DA release in both transgenic mice and their non-transgenic littermates. The efficiency of the inhibition appeared to be different, with mean values of 48% for hMT1 transgenic mice versus 84% for non-transgenic littermates. Moreover, we have evaluated basal and amphetamine-induced locomotion in hMT1 transgenic mice compared with their non-transgenic littermates, using an O-maze behavioral chamber. Basal levels of locomotion in the hMT1 transgenic mice showed that they moved much less than their non-transgenic littermates (0.9 +/- 0.3 m for transgenic mice vs. 2.4 +/- 0.7 m for non-transgenic littermates, p < 0.05). This relative reduction in locomotion was also observed following amphetamine administration (48.5 +/- 6.7 m for transgenics vs. 73.7 +/- 9.8 m for non-transgenics, p < 0.05). These results support the finding that there are altered dynamics of DA release and reuptake in hMT1 transgenic mice in vivo, with DAT activity is reduced in the presence of mutant torsinA, which is consistent with behavioral consequences such as reduced locomotion and (previously described) abnormal motor phenotypes such as increased hind-base width and impaired performance on the raised-beam task.

This suggests that torsinA holds luciferase in an intermediate state, which can then be refolded in the presence of other chaperones.

While inclusion formation is a characteristic feature for ΔE TOR1A, elevated levels of aggregates for other mutations were not observed when compared with WT TOR1A. WT and mutant TOR1A showed preferred degradation through the autophagy-lysosome pathway, which is most pronounced for p.A14_P15del, p.R288Q, and ΔE TOR1A. Notably, blocking of the autophagy pathway with bafilomycin resulted in a significant increase in inclusion formation in p.E121K TOR1A. In addition, all variants had an influence on protein stability. Although the p.A14_P15del mutation affects the proposed oligomerization domain of TOR1A, this mutation did not disturb the ability to dimerize. Our findings demonstrate functional changes for all four mutations on different levels.

Symptoms typically appear during childhood, suggesting the presence of an early critical period of sensorimotor circuit susceptibility to torsinA dysfunction.

By means of immunofluorescence, confocal analysis and western blot quantification, we observed a reduced inhibitory input on Purkinje cells (PCs) as well as an unbalanced excitatory innervation; a significant reduction of the parallel fiber (PF) synaptic terminals and an increase of the climbing fiber (CF) inputs. Finally, in support of the in vivo results, we also provide evidence of an impaired PF synaptogenesis in a co-culture system. Of note, these alterations were rescued and in part over-compensated in the adult age in both mouse strains, suggesting that torsinA dysfunction can induce an altered maturation of cerebellar synaptic contacts.

One of the most severe types of dystonia is early-onset torsion dystonia (EOTD). The best studied and validated EOTD-associated mutation, torsinAΔE, is a deletion of a C-terminal glutamate residue in the AAA+ ATPase torsinA. TorsinA appears to be an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/nuclear envelope chaperone with multiple roles in the secretory pathway and in determining subcellular architecture. Many functions are disabled in the torsinAΔE variant, and torsinAΔE is also less stable than wild-type torsinA and is a substrate for ER-associated degradation. Nevertheless, the molecular factors involved in the biogenesis and degradation of torsinA and torsinAΔE have not been fully explored. To identify conserved cellular factors that can alter torsinAΔE protein levels, we designed a new high-throughput, automated, genome-wide screen utilizing our validated <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> torsinA expression system. By analyzing the yeast non-essential gene deletion collection, we identified 365 deletion strains with altered torsinAΔE steady-state levels. One notable hit was <i>EUG1</i>, which encodes a member of the protein disulfide isomerase family (PDIs). PDIs reside in the ER and catalyze the formation of disulfide bonds, mediate protein quality control and aid in nascent protein folding. We validated the role of select human PDIs in torsinA biogenesis in mammalian cells and found that overexpression of PDIs reduced the levels of torsinA and torsinAΔE. Together, our data report the first genome-wide screen to identify cellular factors that alter expression levels of the EOTD-associated protein torsinAΔE. More generally, the identified hits help in dissecting the cellular machinery involved in folding and degrading a torsinA variant, and constitute potential therapeutic factors for EOTD.

Here, we used the glycoprotein torsinA as a model substrate to explore the impact of ER redox homeostasis on PTMs and protein biogenesis.

The deletion of a C-terminal glutamic acid residue (∆E) is associated with the development of Early-Onset Torsion Dystonia, a severe movement disorder. TorsinA differs from other AAA+ ATPases since it is an ER resident, and as a result of its entry into the ER torsinA contains two N-linked glycans and at least one disulfide bond. The role of these PTMs on torsinA biogenesis and function and the identity of the enzymes that catalyze them are poorly defined. Using a yeast torsinA expression system, we demonstrate that a specific protein disulfide isomerase, Pdi1, affects the folding and N-linked glycosylation of torsinA and torsinA∆E in a redox-dependent manner, suggesting that the acquisition of early torsinA folding intermediates is sensitive to perturbed interactions between Cys residues and the quality control machinery.

There is evidence that dysfunction of striatal parvalbumin-reactive (Parv+) fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) can be involved in dystonic signs. To elucidate the relevance of these GABAergic interneurons in the pathophysiology of DYT1 dystonia, we used in vivo optogenetics to specifically inhibit Parv+ and to detect changes in motor behavior and neuronal activity.

Another 160 patients with dystonia were screened for reported and novel variants in THAP1. 280 neurologically healthy controls were screened for the newly identified and previously reported changes in THAP1 and these and an additional 75 controls were screened for a rare non-coding mutation.<h4>Findings</h4>We identified two mutations in THAP1 (388_389delTC and 474delA), respectively, in two (1%) German patients from the 160 patients with dystonia. Both mutation carriers had laryngeal dystonia that started in childhood and both went on to develop generalised dystonia.

Assessment should be performed using a validated rating scale for dystonia. Genetic testing may be performed after establishing the clinical diagnosis. DYT1 testing is recommended for patients with primary dystonia with limb onset before age 30, and in those with an affected relative with early-onset dystonia. DYT6 testing is recommended in early-onset or familial cases with cranio-cervical dystonia or after exclusion of DYT1. Individuals with early-onset myoclonus should be tested for mutations in the DYT11 gene. If direct sequencing of the DYT11 gene is negative, additional gene dosage is required to improve the proportion of mutations detected. A levodopa trial is warranted in every patient with early-onset primary dystonia without an alternative diagnosis. In patients with idiopathic dystonia, neurophysiological tests can help with describing the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the disorder.<h4>Treatment</h4>botulinum toxin (BoNT) type A is the first-line treatment for primary cranial (excluding oromandibular) or cervical dystonia; it is also effective on writing dystonia. BoNT/B is not inferior to BoNT/A in cervical dystonia. Pallidal deep brain stimulation (DBS) is considered a good option, particularly for primary generalized or cervical dystonia, after medication or BoNT have failed.

Conversely, several environmental factors have been associated with primary adult-onset focal dystonias compared to control subjects.

Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the clinical symptoms of dystonia result from abnormalities in dopamine (DA) signaling, and possibly involving its down-stream effector adenylate cyclase that produces the second messenger cyclic adenosine-3', 5'-monophosphate (cAMP). Here we find that mutation in torsinA induces ER stress, and inhibits the cyclic adenosine-3', 5'-monophosphate (cAMP) response to the adenylate cyclase agonist forskolin. Both defective mechanins are corrected by the small molecule 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA) that alleviates ER stress.

Can different types of dystonia be classified as either a basal ganglia disorder or a cerebellar disorder? Is dystonia a network disorder that involves the cerebellum and basal ganglia? If dystonia is a network disorder, how can we target treatments to alleviate symptoms in patients? A recent study by Chen et al, using the pharmacological mouse model of rapid-onset dystonia parkinsonism, has provided some insight into these important questions. They showed that the cerebellum can directly modulate basal ganglia activity through a short latency cerebello-thalamo-basal ganglia pathway. Further, this article and others have provided evidence that in some cases, aberrant cerebello-basal ganglia communication can be involved in dystonia.

The aim of the study: The aim of this study was to verify the chaperone function of torsin 1A by investigating its ability to prevent the aggregation of huntingtin model peptides.<h4>Patients and methods</h4>Materials and methods: N-terminal mutant huntingtin fragments of different length were co-expressed in neuronal HT-22 and non-neuronal HeLa cells with either the wild-type or mutant (ΔE302/303) torsin 1A protein. The transfected cells were immunostained and analyzed for the presence of huntingtin aggregates using fluorescence microscopy.<h4>Results</h4>Results: The immunofluorescence analysis of huntingtin subcellular distribution within the transfected cells showed no significant difference between the huntingtin aggregation levels in cells co-expressing the wild-type torsin 1A and in control cells co-transfected with an empty vector. Instead, it was the increased level of huntingtin aggregation in the presence of the torsion dystonia-causing ΔE302/303 mutant that reached statistical significance in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Conclusions: Either torsin 1A does not function as a chaperone protein or huntingtin is not an efficient substrate for such a hypothetical chaperone activity.

In addition, although emphasis has been placed on dominant isolated dystonia, the disorder is also transmitted as a recessive trait, for which no mutations have been defined. Using whole-exome sequencing in a recessive isolated dystonia-affected kindred, we identified disease-segregating compound heterozygous mutations in COL6A3, a collagen VI gene associated previously with muscular dystrophy. Genetic screening of a further 367 isolated dystonia subjects revealed two additional recessive pedigrees harboring compound heterozygous mutations in COL6A3. Strikingly, all affected individuals had at least one pathogenic allele in exon 41, including an exon-skipping mutation that induced an in-frame deletion. We tested the hypothesis that disruption of this exon is pathognomonic for isolated dystonia by inducing a series of in-frame deletions in zebrafish embryos. Consistent with our human genetics data, suppression of the exon 41 ortholog caused deficits in axonal outgrowth, whereas suppression of other exons phenocopied collagen deposition mutants. All recessive mutation carriers demonstrated early-onset segmental isolated dystonia without muscular disease. Finally, we show that Col6a3 is expressed in neurons, with relevant mRNA levels detectable throughout the adult mouse brain.

"""20301665""","""DYT1 Early-Onset Isolated Dystonia""","""<h4>Clinical characteristics</h4>DYT1 early-onset isolated dystonia typically presents in childhood or adolescence and only on occasion in adulthood. Dystonic muscle contractions causing posturing or irregular tremor of a leg or arm are the most common presenting findings. Dystonia is usually first apparent with specific actions such as writing or walking. Over time, the contractions frequently (but not invariably) become evident with less specific actions and spread to other body regions. No other neurologic abnormalities are present. Disease severity varies considerably even within the same family. Isolated writer's cramp may be the only sign.<h4>Diagnosis/testing</h4>The diagnosis of DYT1 dystonia is established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous TOR1A pathogenic variant on molecular genetic testing. A TOR1A three base-pair deletion, c.907_909delGAG, is identified in most affected individuals.<h4>Management</h4>Treatment of manifestations: Oral medications, either alone or in combination, are usually tried first, including anticholinergics, baclofen, benzodiazepines, and others. Botulinum toxin injections for treatment of focal symptoms can be used in conjunction with oral medications. If oral medications and botulinum toxin injections do not provide sufficient control of symptoms, surgery enabling deep-brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus interna (GPi) should be considered. Prevention of secondary complications: Aggressive medical and surgical intervention to prevent contractures of the joints and deformities of the spine. Surveillance: Follow up with a neurologist specializing in movement disorders several times a year. Agents/circumstances to avoid: The extremities affected by dystonia should not be placed in a brace or cast, unless medically necessary, as this can worsen the dystonia.<h4>Genetic counseling</h4>DYT1 dystonia is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner with reduced penetrance. Offspring of an affected individual or of an asymptomatic individual known to have a TOR1A pathogenic variant have a 50% chance of inheriting the variant and if inherited a 30% chance of developing clinical findings. Once the TOR1A c.907_909delGAG deletion has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing for DYT1 dystonia are possible.""","""2016""",[]

The significance of this gene as a cause of dystonia and its phenotypical characterization must be determined in larger cohorts. We aimed to investigate the role of PRKRA in patients with dystonia. METHODS:We sequenced PRKRA in 153 unrelated Brazilian patients with idiopathic dystonia. The frequency of novel missense variants was investigated in healthy Brazilian controls and in public databases. Homozygosity in the PRKRA region was assessed through polymorphic markers. RESULTS:PRKRA variants were identified in seven probands with isolated dystonia, including a novel c.C795A variant in compound heterozygosity with the previously described c.C665T variant. Heterozygosity in the gene region was observed in two probands who were homozygous for c.C665T, indicating that this mutation originated from independent events, suggesting a hotspot. CONCLUSION:PRKRA is not an unusual cause of idiopathic dystonia. In this cohort, it was responsible for 4.5% of the total of cases (4.9% of the isolated dystonia cases). The most common phenotype was early-onset isolated focal dystonia followed by generalization, parkinsonism was not observed. This is first report of PRKRA causing adulthood-onset dystonia.

In recent years, many new candidate genes are being identified as putative pathogenic factors in children with isolated dystonia due to the easy availability of whole-exome sequencing. Recently biallelic mutations in the COL6A3 gene were identified as a cause of rare dystonia (DYT)-27 syndrome. Till date, only six cases of DYT27 have been reported in the literature. METHODS:We report a new case of COL6A3 mutation associated early-onset isolated dystonia-DYT27. We did a review of the previously published cases of DYT27. Citations were identified through PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Google scholar searches using the search terms (including variations), \""Dystonia-27 or DYT27\"" or/and \""COL6A3 mutation associated early-onset isolated dystonia\"", combined with study filters for original research, case reports and case series. RESULTS:Next-generation sequencing in the index patient revealed two pathogenic compound heterozygous loss of function mutations in exon 10 and exon 12 of the COL6A3 gene coding for the alpha(α)3(VI) chain of type VI collagen. Together with the presented case, seven cases (five males) were available for analysis. The median age at onset was 22 years (range: 6-61). Dystonic symptoms were started from hands in five and from the neck in the remaining two patients. Five patients had favorable outcomes with trihexyphenidyl and botulinum toxin while tetrabenazine and levodopa were ineffective.

EIF2AK2 sequencing in 191 unrelated patients with unexplained dystonia yielded 2 unrelated Caucasian patients with an identical heterozygous c.388G>A, p.Gly130Arg variant, occurring de novo in one case, another patient carrying a different heterozygous variant, c.413G>C, p.Gly138Ala, and one last patient, born from consanguineous parents, carrying a third, homozygous variant c.95A>C, p.Asn32Thr. These 3 missense variants are absent from gnomAD, and are located in functional domains of the encoded protein. In 3 patients, additional neurological manifestations were present, including intellectual disability and spasticity. EIF2AK2 encodes a kinase (protein kinase R [PKR]) that phosphorylates eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α), which orchestrates the cellular stress response. Our expression studies showed abnormally enhanced activation of the cellular stress response, monitored by PKR-mediated phosphorylation of eIF2α, in fibroblasts from patients with EIF2AK2 variants. Intriguingly, PKR can also be regulated by PRKRA (protein interferon-inducible double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase activator A), the product of another gene causing monogenic dystonia.<h4>Interpretation</h4>We identified EIF2AK2 variants implicated in early onset generalized dystonia, which can be dominantly or recessively inherited, or occur de novo.

We developed a simple, reliable, and cost-effective, PCR-based screening method for this mutation. Testing results from a cohort of 550 cases, including patients with different forms of dystonia and unclassified movement disorders, revealed that 72.2% of the patients with typical early-onset generalized PTD carried the GAG deletion in the DYT1 gene. Among 300 cases with late-onset focal/segmental dystonia, only 3 patients tested positive for the GAG deletion whereas 12.8% of the patients with an unclassified movement disorder were GAG positive. Our results confirm a genotype/phenotype correlation in early-onset PTD and show that application of strict clinical criteria leads to accurate prediction of carrier status in more than two-thirds of patients with this type of dystonia. Currently, we suggest that testing be recommended in individuals with age of onset of dystonia below 30 years and/or a positive family history of early-onset PTD.

In the groups below the age of 13, the onset was almost invariably in one of the four limbs. However, in the group 14 years of age and older, 30% had their initial dystonic symptoms in the neck and a total of 40% of the patients whose onset was at age 14 or later, had marked nuchal symptoms. This clear-cut predominance of limb involvement in the youngest groups is also indicated by the observation that 38% in the youngest group had become confined to a wheelchair because of gait abnormalities, whereas none of those whose age of onset was 14 or older were disabled to this degree by gait abnormality. The most rapidly progressive and incapacitating symptomatology was seen in those patients with onset of symptoms below the age of 8 so that in general the younger the age at onset, the more rapid the progress of the symptoms.""","""1976""",[]

"""21907099""","""Genetics and pharmacological treatment of dystonia.""","""Dystonia consists of involuntary repetitive twisting (torsion) or directional movements, sometimes leading to sustained postures. The movements are stereotyped and characterized by co-contraction of agonist and antagonist muscles. There is a broad clinical spectrum of dystonia which derives in part from the differential distribution of involvement. Dystonia may be localized, affecting a single body region, or generalized, affecting multiple extremities along with the trunk. Intermediate dystonic involvement can be described as segmental, designating two affected contiguous body regions, or multifocal, designating two or more noncontiguous affected body regions. Hemidystonia refers to dystonia affecting only one side of the body. Dystonia can also be categorized by age of onset and etiology. Early onset dystonia, occurring in childhood or adolescence (in some studies younger than 26 years old), is associated with more progressive disease [Greene et al. (1995). Mov. Disord. 10, 143]. In this age group, dystonia usually first appears in a limb and then spreads to involve other limbs and axial muscles; some early-onset patients may have involvement of laryngeal and other cranial muscles. Adult or late-onset dystonia typically begins in the neck, arm, or cranial muscles. Compared to early-onset dystonia, the area of involvement is more likely to remain focal or segmental. Dystonia can be considered either primary or nonprimary. Primary torsion dystonia (PTD), historically called dystonia musculorum deformans and Oppenheim's dystonia, describes dystonia in isolation, excepting tremor, without brain degeneration and without an identified acquired cause. Nonprimary or secondary dystonia encompasses a heterogeneous group of syndromes and etiologies including inherited (with or without brain degeneration), acquired, and complex neurological disorders. Monogenic forms of dystonia are labeled DYT and enumerated in the order in which they were discovered. The current 20 DYT loci comprise a heterogeneous group of disorders. (Table I) They can be divided into PTDs, dystonia-plus syndromes without brain degeneration, dystonia-parkinsonism with brain degeneration (i.e. DYT3), and paroxysmal dyskinesias. There are many neurodegenerative genetic disorders that share dystonia as a common feature of disease (Table II).

We present a historical review of early reports and illustrations of geste antagoniste.<h4>Results</h4>In 1894, Brissaud described this phenomenon in Paris in patients with torticollis. He noted that a violent muscular contraction could be reversed by a minor voluntary action. He considered the improvement obtained by what he called \""simple mannerisms, childish behaviour or fake pathological movements\"" was proof of the psychogenic origin of what he named mental torticollis. This concept was supported by photographical illustrations of the patients. The term geste antagoniste was used by Brissaud's pupils, Meige and Feindel, in their 1902 monograph on movement disorders. Other reports and illustrations of this sign were published in Europe between 1894 and 1906. Although not mentioned explicitly, geste antagoniste was also illustrated in a case report of generalized dystonia in Oppenheim's 1911 seminal description of dystonia musculorum deformans in Berlin.<h4>Discussion</h4>Brissaud-Meige's misinterpretation of the geste antagoniste unfortunately anchored the psychogenic origin of dystonia for decades. In New York, Herz brought dystonia back into the realm of organic neurology in 1944. Thereafter, it was given prominence by other authors, notably Fahn and Marsden in the 1970-1980s. Nowadays, neurologists routinely investigate for geste antagoniste when a dystonic syndrome is suspected, because it provides a further argument in favor of dystonia. The term alleviating maneuver was proposed in 2014 to replace sensory trick or geste antagoniste.
