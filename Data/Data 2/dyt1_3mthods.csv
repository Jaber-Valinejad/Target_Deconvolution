Our goal is to identify candidate genes for torsion dystonia as well as other neurologically important genes in this region. To accomplish this we have characterized the expression patterns of transcribed sequences identified within a collection of 3000 human 9q32-34-specific clones. Screening of this clone collection with cDNA probes from various brain and peripheral tissues resulted in the identification of 143 clones corresponding to 9q32-34-specific transcripts. Thirty three of these corresponded to transcripts expressed in a brain-specific manner and thus represent preferred candidates for the dystonia gene. None of these candidates were expressed specifically in the putative dystonia target tissue, basal ganglia. The 9q32-34 collection was screened with a subtracted probe enriched in striatal sequences using a directional tag PCR subtraction method.

TOR1A-associated arthrogryposis multiplex congenita 5 (AMC5) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder arising from biallelic variants in TOR1A, a gene that in the heterozygous state is associated with torsion dystonia-1 (DYT1 or DYT-TOR1A), an early-onset dystonia with reduced penetrance. While 15 individuals with AMC5-TOR1A have been reported (less than 10 in detail), a systematic investigation of the full disease-associated spectrum has not been conducted. Here, we assess the clinical, radiological and molecular characteristics of 57 individuals from 40 families with biallelic variants in TOR1A. Median age at last follow-up was 3 years (0-24 years). Most individuals presented with severe congenital flexion contractures (95%) and variable developmental delay (79%). Motor symptoms were reported in 79% and included lower limb spasticity and pyramidal signs, as well as gait disturbances. Facial dysmorphism was an integral part of the phenotype, with key features being a broad/full nasal tip, narrowing of the forehead and full cheeks. Analysis of disease-associated manifestations delineated a phenotypic spectrum ranging from normal cognition and mild gait disturbance to congenital arthrogryposis, global developmental delay, intellectual disability, absent speech and inability to walk. In a subset, the presentation was consistent with foetal akinesia deformation sequence with severe intrauterine abnormalities. Survival was 71%, with higher mortality in males. Death occurred at a median age of 1.2 months (1 week-9 years), due to respiratory failure, cardiac arrest or sepsis. Analysis of brain MRI studies identified non-specific neuroimaging features, including a hypoplastic corpus callosum (72%), foci of signal abnormality in the subcortical and periventricular white matter (55%), diffuse white matter volume loss (45%), mega cisterna magna (36%) and arachnoid cysts (27%). The molecular spectrum included 22 distinct variants, defining a mutational hotspot in the C-terminal domain of the Torsin-1A protein. Genotype-phenotype analysis revealed an association of missense variants in the 3-helix bundle domain to an attenuated phenotype, while missense variants near the Walker A/B motif as well as biallelic truncating variants were linked to early death. In summary, this systematic cross-sectional analysis of a large cohort of individuals with biallelic TOR1A variants across a wide age-range delineates the clinical and genetic spectrum of TOR1A-related autosomal-recessive disease and highlights potential predictors for disease severity and survival.""","""2023""","[""tor1a-related disorders"", ""autosomal-recessive disease"", ""early death"", ""torsin-1a"", ""arachnoid cysts"", ""mega cisterna magna"", ""white matter volume loss"", ""hypoplastic corpus callosum"", ""sepsis"", ""cardiac arrest"", ""respiratory failure"", ""death"", ""intrauterine abnormalities"", ""fetal akinesia"", ""inability to walk"", ""absent speech"", ""intellectual disability"", ""congenital arthrogryposis"", ""gait disturbance"", ""facial dysmorphism"", ""gait disturbances"", ""pyramidal signs"", ""spasticity"", ""developmental delay"", ""congenital flexion contractures"", ""tor1a."", ""dystonia"", ""dyt1"", ""torsion dystonia-1"", ""tor1a"", ""neurodevelopmental disorder"", ""amc5"", ""tor1a-associated arthrogryposis multiplex congenita 5"", ""neurodegeneration"", ""neurodevelopmental disorders"", ""autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative diseases"", ""rare diseases""]"

There is evidence that dysfunction of striatal parvalbumin-reactive (Parv+) fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) can be involved in dystonic signs. To elucidate the relevance of these GABAergic interneurons in the pathophysiology of DYT1 dystonia, we used in vivo optogenetics to specifically inhibit Parv+ and to detect changes in motor behavior and neuronal activity. Optogenetic fibers were bilaterally implanted into the dorsal striatum of male DYT1 KI mice and wild-type (WT) littermates expressing halorhodopsin (eNpHR3.0) in Parv+ interneurons. While stimulations with yellow light pulses for up to 60 min at different pulse durations and interval lengths did not induce abnormal movements, such as dystonic signs, immunohistochemical examinations revealed genotype-dependent differences. In contrast to WT mice, stimulated DYT1 KI showed decreased striatal neuronal activity, that is, less c-Fos reactive neurons, and increased activation of cholinergic interneurons after optogenetic inhibition of Parv+ interneurons. These findings suggest an involvement of Parv+ interneurons in an impaired striatal network in DYT1 KI mice, but at least short-term inhibition of these GABAergic interneurons is not sufficient to trigger a dystonic phenotype, similar to previously shown optogenetic activation of cholinergic interneurons.""","""2022""","[""parvalbumin"", ""dystonic"", ""c-fos"", ""abnormal movements"", ""dystonia"", ""human"", ""dyt1"", ""tor1a"", ""torsion dystonia"", ""mice"", ""dystonic signs""]"

It is caused mainly by a heterozygous trinucleotide deletion in DYT1/TOR1A, coding for torsinA. The mutation may lead to a partial loss of torsinA function. Functional alterations of the basal ganglia circuits have been implicated in this disease. Striatal dopamine receptor 2 (D2R) levels are significantly decreased in DYT1 dystonia patients and in the animal models of DYT1 dystonia. D2R-expressing cells, such as the medium spiny neurons in the indirect pathway, striatal cholinergic interneurons, and dopaminergic neurons in the basal ganglia circuits, contribute to motor performance. However, the function of torsinA in these neurons and its contribution to the motor symptoms is not clear. Here, D2R-expressing-cell-specific Dyt1 conditional knockout (d2KO) mice were generated and in vivo effects of torsinA loss in the corresponding cells were examined. The Dyt1 d2KO mice showed significant reductions of striatal torsinA, acetylcholine metabolic enzymes, Tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA), and cholinergic interneurons. The Dyt1 d2KO mice also showed significant reductions of striatal D2R dimers and tyrosine hydroxylase without significant alteration in striatal monoamine contents or the number of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. The Dyt1 d2KO male mice showed motor deficits in the accelerated rotarod and beam-walking tests without overt dystonic symptoms. Moreover, the Dyt1 d2KO male mice showed significant correlations between striatal monoamines and locomotion.

Three forms of isolated human dystonia result from mutations in the <i>TOR1A</i> (DYT1), <i>THAP1</i> (DYT6), and <i>GNAL</i> (DYT25) genes. Experimental models carrying these mutations facilitate identification of possible shared cellular mechanisms. Recently, we reported elevated extracellular striatal acetylcholine by <i>in vivo</i> microdialysis and paradoxical excitation of cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) by dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) agonism using <i>ex vivo</i> slice electrophysiology in <i>Dyt1</i> <sup>ΔGAG/+</sup> mice. The paradoxical excitation was caused by overactive muscarinic receptors (mAChRs), leading to a switch in D2R coupling from canonical G<sub>i/o</sub> to noncanonical β-arrestin signaling. We sought to determine whether these mechanisms in <i>Dyt1</i> <sup>ΔGAG/+</sup> mice are shared with <i>Thap1</i> <sup>C54Y/+</sup> knock-in and <i>Gnal</i> <sup>+/-</sup> knock-out dystonia models and to determine the impact of sex. We found <i>Thap1</i> <sup>C54Y/+</sup> mice of both sexes have elevated extracellular striatal acetylcholine and D2R-induced paradoxical ChI excitation, which was reversed by mAChR inhibition. Elevated extracellular acetylcholine was absent in male and female <i>Gnal</i> <sup>+/-</sup> mice, but the paradoxical D2R-mediated ChI excitation was retained and only reversed by inhibition of adenosine A2ARs. The G<sub>i/o</sub>-preferring D2R agonist failed to increase ChI excitability, suggesting a possible switch in coupling of D2Rs to β-arrestin, as seen previously in a DYT1 model. These data show that, whereas elevated extracellular acetylcholine levels are not always detected across these genetic models of human dystonia, the D2R-mediated paradoxical excitation of ChIs is shared and is caused by altered function of distinct G-protein-coupled receptors.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Dystonia is a common and often disabling movement disorder. The usual medical treatment of dystonia is pharmacotherapy with nonselective antagonists of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, which have many undesirable side effects.

Dystonia has traditionally been considered a disorder of the basal ganglia. However, growing evidence suggests that the cerebellum may be involved in certain types of dystonia, raising several questions. Can different types of dystonia be classified as either a basal ganglia disorder or a cerebellar disorder? Is dystonia a network disorder that involves the cerebellum and basal ganglia? If dystonia is a network disorder, how can we target treatments to alleviate symptoms in patients? A recent study by Chen et al, using the pharmacological mouse model of rapid-onset dystonia parkinsonism, has provided some insight into these important questions. They showed that the cerebellum can directly modulate basal ganglia activity through a short latency cerebello-thalamo-basal ganglia pathway. Further, this article and others have provided evidence that in some cases, aberrant cerebello-basal ganglia communication can be involved in dystonia. In this review we examine the evidence for the involvement of the cerebellum and cerebello-basal ganglia interactions in dystonia.

DYT1 early-onset primary dystonia is the most common form of hereditary dystonia and is caused by deletion of a glutamic acid residue (302/303) near the carboxyl-terminus of encoded torsinA. TorsinA is localized primarily within the contiguous lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and nuclear envelope (NE), and is hypothesized to function as a molecular chaperone and an important regulator of the ER stress-signaling pathway, but how the mutation in torsinA causes disease remains unclear. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the clinical symptoms of dystonia result from abnormalities in dopamine (DA) signaling, and possibly involving its down-stream effector adenylate cyclase that produces the second messenger cyclic adenosine-3', 5'-monophosphate (cAMP). Here we find that mutation in torsinA induces ER stress, and inhibits the cyclic adenosine-3', 5'-monophosphate (cAMP) response to the adenylate cyclase agonist forskolin. Both defective mechanins are corrected by the small molecule 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA) that alleviates ER stress. Our results link torsinA, the ER-stress-response, and cAMP-dependent signaling, and suggest 4-PBA could also be used in dystonia treatment. Other pharmacological agents known to modulate the cAMP cascade, and ER stress may also be therapeutic in dystonia patients and can be tested in the models described here, thus supplementing current efforts centered on the dopamine pathway.""","""2014""","[""4-phenylbutyrate"", ""patients"", ""4-pba"", ""forskolin"", ""camp"", ""cyclic adenosine-3'"", "" 5'-monophosphate"", ""da"", ""dopamine"", ""torsina"", ""torsina."", ""hereditary dystonia"", ""primary dystonia"", ""neurological disorder"", ""dystonia"", ""dyt1"", ""cyclic amp""]"

Terminology has changed and 'isolated dystonia' is used wherein dystonia is the only motor feature apart from tremor, and the previously called heredodegenerative dystonias and dystonia plus syndromes are now subsumed under 'combined dystonia'. The recently discovered genes ANO3, GNAL and CIZ1 appear not to be a common cause of adult-onset cervical dystonia. Clinical and genetic heterogeneity underlie myoclonus-dystonia, dopa-responsive dystonia and deafness-dystonia syndrome. ALS2 gene mutations are a newly recognized cause for combined dystonia. The phenotypic and genotypic spectra of ATP1A3 mutations have considerably broadened. Two new genome-wide association studies identified new candidate genes. A retrospective analysis suggested complicated vaginal delivery as a modifying risk factor in DYT1. Recent studies confirm lasting therapeutic effects of deep brain stimulation in isolated dystonia, good treatment response in myoclonus-dystonia, and suggest that early treatment correlates with a better outcome.<h4>Summary</h4>Phenotypic classification continues to be important to recognize particular forms of dystonia and this includes syndromic associations.

Evidence suggests that TOR1A mutation produces dystonia through an aberrant neuronal signalling within the striatum, where D2 dopamine receptors (D2R) produce an abnormal excitatory response in cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) in different models of DYT1 dystonia. The excitability of ChIs may be modulated by group I metabotropic glutamate receptor subtypes (mGlu1 and 5). We performed electrophysiological and calcium imaging recordings from ChIs of both knock-in mice heterozygous for Δ-torsinA (Tor1a(+/Δgag) mice) and transgenic mice overexpressing human torsinA (hMT1). We demonstrate that the novel negative allosteric modulator (NAM) of metabotropic glutamate 5 (mGlu) receptor, dipraglurant (ADX48621) counteracts the abnormal membrane responses and calcium rise induced either by the D2R agonist quinpirole or by caged dopamine (NPEC-Dopamine) in both models. These inhibitory effects were mimicked by two other well-characterized mGlu5 receptor antagonists, SIB1757 and MPEP, but not by mGlu1 antagonism. D2R and mGlu5 post-receptor signalling may converge on PI3K/Akt pathway. Interestingly, we found that the abnormal D2R response was prevented by the selective PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, whereas PLC and PKC inhibitors were both ineffective. Currently, no satisfactory pharmacological treatment is available for DYT1 dystonia patients.

Targeting the intrinsic capacities of neuroprotective proteins to restore neuronal function and/or attenuate degeneration represents a potential means toward therapeutic intervention. The product of the human DYT1 gene, torsinA, is a member of the functionally diverse AAA+ family of proteins and exhibits robust molecular-chaperone-like activity, both in vitro and in vivo. Although mutations in DYT1 are associated with a rare form of heritable generalized dystonia, the native function of torsinA seems to be cytoprotective in maintaining the cellular threshold to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Here we explore the potential for torsinA to serve as a buffer to attenuate the cellular consequences of misfolded-protein stress as it pertains to the neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The selective vulnerability of motor neurons to degeneration in ALS mouse models harboring mutations in superoxide dismutase (SOD1) has been found to correlate with regional-specific ER stress in brains. Using Caenorhabditis elegans as a system to model ER stress, we generated transgenic nematodes overexpressing either wild-type or mutant human SOD1 to evaluate their relative impact on ER stress induction in vivo. These studies revealed a mutant-SOD1-specific increase in ER stress that was further exacerbated by changes in temperature, all of which was robustly attenuated by co-expression of torsinA. Moreover, through complementary behavioral analysis, torsinA was able to restore normal neuronal function in mutant G85R SOD1 animals. Furthermore, torsinA targeted mutant SOD1 for degradation via the proteasome, representing mechanistic insight on the activity that torsinA has on aggregate-prone proteins.

Isolated dystonia (with dystonic tremor) can be caused by mutations in TOR1A (DYT1), TUBB4 (DYT4), THAP1 (DYT6), PRKRA (DYT16), CIZ1 (DYT23), ANO3 (DYT24), and GNAL (DYT25).

Recent insights from neurophysiologic studies identified functional abnormalities in two networks in dystonia: the basal ganglia-sensorimotor network and, more recently, the cerebellothalamocortical pathway. Besides the well-known lack of inhibition at different CNS levels, dystonia is specifically characterized by maladaptive plasticity in the sensorimotor cortex and loss of cortical surround inhibition. The exact role (modulatory or compensatory) of the cerebellar-cortical pathways still has to be further elucidated. In addition to botulinum toxin for focal forms, deep brain stimulation of the globus pallidus internus is increasingly recognized as an effective treatment for generalized and segmental dystonia.<h4>Summary</h4>The revised classification and identification of new genes for different forms of dystonia, including adult-onset segmental dystonia, enable an improved diagnostic approach.

""","""Dystonia is a movement disorder characterized by involuntary muscle contractions that cause twisting movements and abnormal postures. Primary dystonia is the most common form and is thought to be a multifactorial condition in which one or more genes combine with environmental factors to reach disease. We reviewed controlled studies on possible environmental risk factors for primary early- and late-onset dystonia. Environmental factors associated with primary early-onset dystonia are poorly understood. Early childhood illnesses have been reported to be more frequent in patients with DYT1 dystonia than in subjects carrying the DYT1 mutation that did not manifest dystonia, thus raising the possibility that such exposures precipitate dystonia among DYT1 carriers. Conversely, several environmental factors have been associated with primary adult-onset focal dystonias compared to control subjects. Namely, eye diseases, sore throat, idiopathic scoliosis, and repetitive upper limb motor action seem to be associated with blepharospasm (BSP), laryngeal dystonia (LD), cervical dystonia (CD), and upper limb dystonia, respectively. In addition, an inverse association between coffee drinking and BSP has been observed in both case-unrelated control and family-based case-control studies. Additional evidence supporting a causal link with different forms of primary late-onset dystonia is only available for diseases of the anterior segment of the eye, writing activity, and coffee intake. There is reasonable epidemiological evidence that some environmental factors are risk-modifying factors for specific forms of primary adult-onset focal dystonia.""","""2013""","[""focal dystonia"", ""diseases of the anterior segment of the eye"", ""upper limb dystonia"", ""cd"", ""cervical dystonia"", ""ld"", ""laryngeal dystonia"", ""bsp"", ""blepharospasm"", ""idiopathic scoliosis"", ""sore throat"", ""eye diseases"", ""focal dystonias"", ""dyt1"", ""patients"", ""involuntary muscle contractions"", ""movement disorder"", ""dystonia"", ""primary dystonia""]"

Monogenic defects have been found to underlie many forms of dystonia syndromes, which are designated DYT1-20. Dystonias with known genes include DYT1 and DYT6 dystonia, presenting as isolated torsion dystonia, as well as DYT5 (dopa-responsive dystonia), DYT11 (myoclonus-dystonia), and DYT12 (rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism), where dystonia occurs in conjunction with other types of movement disorders. All of these conditions follow an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance, usually develop in childhood or early adolescence, and show an initially progressive course with stabilization in early adulthood. In secondary dystonias, there are often atypical features and additional neurological signs, such as prominent tongue and perioral involvement, pyramidal signs, ataxia, oculomotor abnormalities, or cognitive disturbances.

To understand the pathophysiology of these disorders better, we compared the similarities and differences in functional neuroimaging of patients with psychogenic dystonia and genetically determined dystonia, and tested hypotheses on the role of the prefrontal cortex in functional neurological disorders. Patients with psychogenic (n = 6) or organic (n = 5, DYT1 gene mutation positive) dystonia of the right leg, and matched healthy control subjects (n = 6) underwent positron emission tomography of regional cerebral blood flow. Participants were studied during rest, during fixed posturing of the right leg and during paced ankle movements. Continuous surface electromyography and footplate manometry monitored task performance. Averaging regional cerebral blood flow across all tasks, the organic dystonia group showed abnormal increases in the primary motor cortex and thalamus compared with controls, with decreases in the cerebellum. In contrast, the psychogenic dystonia group showed the opposite pattern, with abnormally increased blood flow in the cerebellum and basal ganglia, with decreases in the primary motor cortex. Comparing organic dystonia with psychogenic dystonia revealed significantly greater regional blood flow in the primary motor cortex, whereas psychogenic dystonia was associated with significantly greater blood flow in the cerebellum and basal ganglia (all P < 0.05, family-wise whole-brain corrected). Group × task interactions were also examined. During movement, compared with rest, there was abnormal activation in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex that was common to both organic and psychogenic dystonia groups (compared with control subjects, P < 0.05, family-wise small-volume correction). These data show a cortical-subcortical differentiation between organic and psychogenic dystonia in terms of regional blood flow, both at rest and during active motor tasks. The pathological prefrontal cortical activation was confirmed in, but was not specific to, psychogenic dystonia. This suggests that psychogenic and organic dystonia have different cortical and subcortical pathophysiology, while a derangement in mechanisms of motor attention may be a feature of both conditions.""","""2013""","[""organic and psychogenic dystonia"", ""dyt1"", ""neurological disorders"", ""dystonia"", ""patients"", ""psychogenic dystonia"", ""psychogenic movement disorders"", ""organic dystonia"", ""psychogenic""]"

Significantly better outcomes were achieved with stimulation of the globus pallidus internus (GPi) than with stimulation of the posterior portion of the ventral lateral (VLp) nucleus of the thalamus (p = 0.0001). The etiology of the dystonia also had a significant effect on outcomes. Statistically significant improvements in outcomes were seen for all etiologic categories, except encephalitis. Dystonia due to birth injury and encephalitis had significantly worse outcomes when compared to other etiologies.

Longer duration of dystonia symptoms correlated negatively with surgical outcome. A regression model using the three variables-stimulation site, etiology of dystonia, and duration of dystonia symptoms-explained 51% of the variance in outcomes.

Diagnoses, surgical technique, and complications were noted. Outcomes were assessed using standard rating scales of neurological function.<h4>Results</h4>Of 815 patients undergoing DBS implantation over a 12-year period, 31 were children (mean age at surgery 13.2 years old, range 4-17 years old). Diagnoses included the following: DYT1 primary dystonia (autosomal dominant, Tor1AΔGAG mutation, 10 cases), non-DYT1 primary dystonia (3 cases), secondary dystonia (11 cases), neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA, 3 cases), levodopa-responsive parkinsonism (2 cases), Lesch-Nyhan disease (1 case), and glutaric aciduria Type 1 (1 case). Six children ages 15-17 years old underwent awake microelectrode-guided surgery. For 25 children operated under general anesthesia, the surgical technique evolved from microelectrode-guided surgery to image-guided surgeries using real-time intraoperative MR imaging or CT for lead location confirmation. Complications included 5 hardware infections, all in children younger than 10 years old. At 1 year after implantation, patients with DYT1 dystonia had a mean improvement in the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale movement subscore of 75%, while those with secondary dystonia had only small improvements. Outcomes in the 3 children with NBIA were disappointing.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Results of DBS in children with primary and secondary dystonias were similar to those in adults, with excellent results for DYT1 dystonia in children without fixed orthopedic deformity and much more modest results in secondary dystonia.

This analysis revealed that, normally, torsinA serves a protective function to maintain a homeostatic threshold against ER stress. Furthermore, we show that the buffering capacity of torsinA is greatly diminished by the DYT1-associated deletion or mutations that prevent its translocation to the ER, block ATPase activity, or increase the levels of torsinA in the nuclear envelope versus ER. Combinations of transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans designed to mimic clinically relevant genetic modifiers of disease susceptibility also exhibit a direct functional correlation to changes in the ER stress response.

We have focussed on (i) primary generalized dystonia, (ii) cervical dystonia, (iii) writer's cramp and (iv) fixed dystonia related to complex regional pain syndrome. We have studied medical texts published since the 19th century and their references. Jean-Martin Charcot advocated the concept of hysteria, disorders in which, besides predisposition, environmental factors were involved in their pathogenesis. Sigmund Freud introduced psychoanalysis as an explanatory therapy for psychic disorders. Previous theories, together with the lack of an organic substrate for dystonia, made a strong case for psychogenic explanations. Consequently, many dystonia patients were told that they suffered from psychological conflicts and were treated for them. However, after the description of new hereditary cases in the 1950s, the limited efficacy of psychotherapy in torsion dystonia, the effects of surgical treatments and the lesion studies in the 1960s, more physicians became convinced of the organic nature. The culminating point was the discovery of the DYT1 gene in 1997. In the meantime, experts had already convinced the neurological community that cervical dystonia and writer's cramp were focal dystonias, i.e. minor forms of generalized dystonia, and therefore organic disorders. In contrast, the pathophysiology of fixed dystonia related to complex regional pain syndrome remained controversial. Knowledge of this history, which played on the border between neurology and psychiatry, is instructive and reflects the difficulty in discriminating between them. Today, new insights from functional imaging and neurophysiological studies again challenge the interpretation of these disorders, while the border between psychogenic and organic has become more blurred. Abnormalities of sensorimotor integration and cortical excitability that are currently supposed to be the underlying cause of dystonia bring us back to Sherringtonian physiology.

Transmitted in an autosomal dominant manner with reduced penetrance, EOTD is caused in most cases by the deletion of a glutamic acid (DeltaE) in the DYT1 (also known as TOR1A) gene product, torsinA. Although some patients respond well to anticholingerics, therapy is primarily limited to either neurosurgery or chemodenervation. As mutant torsinA (DeltaE) expression results in decreased torsinA function, therapeutic strategies directed toward enhancement of wild-type (WT) torsinA activity in patients who are heterozygous for mutant DYT1 may restore normal cellular functionality. Here, we report results from the first-ever screen for candidate small molecule therapeutics for EOTD, using multiple activity-based readouts for torsinA function in Caenorhabditis elegans, subsequent validation in human DYT1 patient fibroblasts, and behavioral rescue in a mouse model of DYT1 dystonia. We exploited the nematode to rapidly discern chemical effectors of torsinA and identified two classes of antibiotics, quinolones and aminopenicillins, which enhance WT torsinA activity in two separate in vivo assays. Representative molecules were assayed in EOTD patient fibroblasts for improvements in torsinA-dependent secretory function, which was improved significantly by ampicillin. Furthermore, a behavioral defect associated with an EOTD mouse knock-in model was also rescued following administration of ampicillin. These combined data indicate that specific small molecules that enhance torsinA activity represent a promising new approach toward therapeutic development for EOTD, and potentially for other diseases involving the processing of mutant proteins.""","""2010""","[""torsina"", ""behavioral defect"", ""ampicillin"", ""aminopenicillins"", ""quinolones"", ""dystonia"", ""dyt1"", ""mouse"", ""patient"", ""human"", ""caenorhabditis elegans"", ""patients"", ""torsina."", ""tor1a"", ""and involuntary muscle contractions"", ""eotd"", ""movement disorders"", ""torsion dystonia""]"

Two were small deletions, 2 were nonsense, and 5 were missense. Eight mutations were heterozygous, and 1 was homozygous. The main clinical presentation of cases with THAP1 mutations was early-onset (<30 years) dystonia in the craniocervical region or the limbs (8 of 9 patients). There was phenotypic variability with laryngeal or oromandibular dystonia present in 3 cases. Four of 9 THAP1 cases developed generalized dystonia.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The number of THAP1 mutations has been significantly expanded, indicating an uncommon but important cause of dystonia. Coding mutations account for 9 of 362 dystonia cases, indicating a mutation frequency of 2.5% of dystonia cases in the population that we have screened. The majority of cases reported here with THAP1 mutations had craniocervical- or limb-onset segmental dystonia, but we also identified 1 homozygous THAP1 mutation, associated initially with writer's dystonia and then developing segmental dystonia.

In contrast to the frequent sporadic forms, a variety of rare familial forms are caused by genetic mutations with mendelian inheritance. In recent years, significant progress has been made with regard to the identification of genes causing dystonia, and to the molecular pathophysiology underlying dystonic symptoms. Currently, 18 gene loci have been described causing primary dystonia, dystonia-plus syndromes or paroxysmal dystonia. The most frequent form of inherited dystonia, according to current knowledge, is early-onset generalized DYT1 dystonia, caused by a deletion of three basepairs, GAG, in the DYT1 (TOR1A) gene. It is thought that the protein encoded by this gene, torsinA, participates in association of the endoplasmatic reticulum and the nuclear envelope with the cytoskeleton and hereby might influence the reaction of cells to various stresses and/or the development of specific neuronal populations involved in movement control in the brain. Other genes which have only recently been identified include: THAP1, causing adolescent-onset primary dystonia of mixed type (DYT6); ATP1A3, responsible for Rapid-Onset Dystonia-Parkinsonism (RDP, DYT12); PRKRA, causing young-onset dystonia-parkinsonism (DYT16); and SLC2A1, causing paroxysmal exertion-induced dystonia with haemolytic anemia (DYT18).

Here, we asked how the DYT1 mutation affects association of torsinA with interacting proteins. Using immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, we first established that the related transmembrane proteins LULL1 and LAP1 are prominent binding partners for torsinA in U2OS cells. Comparative analysis demonstrates that these two proteins are targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum or nuclear envelope by their divergent N-terminal domains. Binding of torsinA to their C-terminal lumenal domains is stabilized when residues in any one of three motifs implicated in ATP hydrolysis (Walker B, sensor 1, and sensor 2) are mutated. Importantly, the DeltaGAG deletion does not stabilize this binding. Indeed, deleting the DeltaGAG encoded glutamic acid residue from any of the three ATP hydrolysis mutants destabilizes their association with LULL1 and LAP1C, suggesting a possible basis for loss of torsinA function. Impaired interaction of torsinA with LULL1 and/or LAP1 may thus contribute to the development of dystonia.""","""2009""","[""torsina"", ""atp"", ""u2os"", ""lap1"", ""lull1"", ""torsina."", ""movement disorder"", ""torsion dystonia"", ""dyt1"", ""dystonia""]"

Twelve forms are inherited as autosomal dominant, four as autosomal recessive and one as an X-linked recessive trait. Three additional autosomal dominant forms (DYT9, DYT19 and DYT20) might exist based on linkage mapping to regions apparently different from, yet in close proximity to or overlapping with the known loci DYT18, DYT10 and DYT8. Clinically, this group of movement disorders includes pure dystonias and dystonia plus syndromes. In addition, dyskinesias (paroxysmal dystonias), although phenotypically distinct from classical dystonias, are discussed within this group. In pure dystonias, dystonia is occasionally accompanied by tremor. In dystonia plus syndromes, dystonia as the prominent sign concurs with other movement abnormalities such as myoclonus and parkinsonism. In the dyskinesias, dystonia occurs as a paroxysmal sign in association with other movement anomalies and sometimes seizures. While gross neuropathological changes are absent in most primary dystonias, including the paroxysmal forms, striking morphological alterations are found in some, such as in the X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism syndrome (DYT3). Neuropathological findings at the microscopic level have also been reported in several cases of dystonia 1 and 5, both of which were previously thought to be morphologically normal. One locus, DYT14 had been erroneously assigned, by linkage mapping, in a family with dystonia 5. There are two forms of dystonia 5, one autosomal dominant and one autosomal recessive.

In addition, we strived to find predictors for treatment outcome by review and analysis of previously published studies.<h4>Methods</h4>Six patients with primary generalized dystonia underwent chronic bilateral stimulation of the globus pallidus internus. A PubMed and MEDLINE search was performed in order to identify children and adolescents who underwent deep brain stimulation for primary generalized dystonia. The primary efficacy endpoint was the relative change of the Burke-Fahn-Marsden-Dystonia-Rating-Scale (movement score) after surgery.<h4>Results</h4>Forty-four patients were found to meet the inclusion criteria. The mean age at onset of the disease was 7.8+/-2.8years and the mean age at surgery was 14.2+/-3.5years.

Recently, two mutations in THAP1, the gene that encodes THAP (thanatos-associated protein) domain-containing apoptosis-associated protein 1 (THAP1), have been identified as a cause of DYT6 dystonia.<h4>Methods</h4>We screened THAP1 by sequence analysis and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 160 white patients of European ancestry who had dystonia with an early age at onset (n=64), generalised dystonia (n=35), a positive family history of dystonia (n=56), or facial or laryngeal dystonia. Another 160 patients with dystonia were screened for reported and novel variants in THAP1. 280 neurologically healthy controls were screened for the newly identified and previously reported changes in THAP1 and these and an additional 75 controls were screened for a rare non-coding mutation.<h4>Findings</h4>We identified two mutations in THAP1 (388_389delTC and 474delA), respectively, in two (1%) German patients from the 160 patients with dystonia. Both mutation carriers had laryngeal dystonia that started in childhood and both went on to develop generalised dystonia. Thus, two of three patients with early-onset generalised dystonia with orobulbar involvement had mutations in THAP1.

However, it was unclear whether these changes are characteristic of these particular disorders or an epiphenomenon of dystonic conditions in general.<h4>Methods</h4>Six cases of adult-onset dystonia and four controls were studied using immunohistochemistry to determine the presence of inclusion bodies immunoreactive for torsinA, ubiquitin, and laminA/C in the brainstem. The distribution of calcineurin expressing neurons in the striatum was also determined to ascertain whether there is loss of neurons in the striosome compartment.<h4>Results</h4>In contrast to early-onset dystonia, neuronal inclusions immunoreactive for torsinA, ubiquitin, and laminA/C were not present in the brainstem nuclei.

Abnormal activity in the pallidal-thalamic-cortical circuit, especially in the globus pallidus internus, is the proposed cause of dystonic symptoms. However, recent neuroimaging studies suggest significant contribution of the cerebral cortex. To understand the contribution of the cerebral cortex to dystonia, we produced cerebral cortex-specific Dyt1 conditional knockout mice and analysed their behaviour. The conditional knockout mice exhibited motor deficits and hyperactivity that mimic the reported behavioural deficits in Dyt1 DeltaGAG knockin heterozygous and Dyt1 knockdown mice. Although the latter two mice exhibit lower levels of dopamine metabolites in the striatum, the conditional knockout mice did not show significant alterations in the striatal dopamine and its metabolites levels. The conditional knockout mice had well-developed whisker-related patterns in somatosensory cortex, suggesting formations of synapses and neural circuits were largely unaffected. The results suggest that the loss of torsinA function in the cerebral cortex alone is sufficient to induce behavioural deficits associated with Dyt1 DeltaGAG knockin mutation.

We used a sensitive reporter, Gaussia luciferase (Gluc) to evaluate the role of torsinA in processing proteins through the ER. In primary fibroblasts from controls and DYT1 patients most Gluc activity (95%) was released into the media and processed through the secretory pathway, as confirmed by inhibition with brefeldinA and nocodazole. Fusion of Gluc to a fluorescent protein revealed coalignment and fractionation with ER proteins and association of Gluc with torsinA. Notably, fibroblasts from DYT1 patients were found to secrete markedly less Gluc activity as compared with control fibroblasts. This decrease in processing of Gluc in DYT1 cells appear to arise, at least in part, from a loss of torsinA activity, because mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking torsinA also had reduced secretion as compared with control cells.

Mutations in the gene encoding epsilon-sarcoglycan (SGCE) have been found in some patients with MDS. SGCE is a maternally imprinted gene with the disease being inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern with reduced penetrance upon maternal transmission. In the central nervous system, epsilon-sarcoglycan is widely expressed in neurons of the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, hippocampus, cerebellum and the olfactory bulb. epsilon-Sarcoglycan is located at the plasma membrane in neurons, muscle and transfected cells. To determine the effect of MDS-associated mutations on the function of epsilon-sarcoglycan we examined the biosynthesis and trafficking of wild-type and mutant proteins in cultured cells. In contrast to the wild-type protein, disease-associated epsilon-sarcoglycan missense mutations (H36P, H36R and L172R) produce proteins that are undetectable at the cell surface and are retained intracellularly. These mutant proteins become polyubiquitinated and are rapidly degraded by the proteasome. Furthermore, torsinA, that is mutated in DYT1 dystonia, a rare type of primary dystonia, binds to and promotes the degradation of epsilon-sarcoglycan mutants when both proteins are co-expressed. These data demonstrate that some MDS-associated mutations in SGCE impair trafficking of the mutant protein to the plasma membrane and suggest a role for torsinA and the ubiquitin proteasome system in the recognition and processing of misfolded epsilon-sarcoglycan.""","""2007""","[""sgce"", ""primary dystonia"", ""dyt1"", ""l172r"", ""h36r"", ""h36p"", ""patients"", ""epilepsy"", ""psychiatric"", ""dystonia"", ""myoclonic jerks"", ""mds"", ""torsina"", ""epsilon-sarcoglycan"", ""myoclonus-dystonia syndrome""]"

The estimated prevalence in the Ashkenazi Jewish population is approximately five to ten times higher, due to a founder mutation. Symptoms of EOTD typically develop first in an arm or leg in middle to late childhood and progress in approximately 30% of patients to other body regions (generalized dystonia) within about five years. Distribution and severity of symptoms vary widely between affected individuals.

We reviewed the literature to compare the frequency of DYT1 mutation between the East and the West.<h4>Methods</h4>We screened 54 patients with primary dystonia (focal: n=41; segmental: n=11; multifocal: n=1; generalized: n=1) for the deletions in the DYT1 gene. A careful review of all published literature on DYT1 screening among sporadic, non-familial, non-Ashkenazi Jewish patients was done.<h4>Results</h4>We did not detect any mutations in the exon 5 of the DYT1 gene in any of our patients.

"""16537570""","""Effects of genetic variations in the dystonia protein torsinA: identification of polymorphism at residue 216 as protein modifier.""","""Four naturally occurring sequence variations have been found in the coding region of the DYT1 gene encoding torsinA. One of these, a 3 bp (DeltaGAG) deletion, underlies dominantly inherited cases of early-onset torsion dystonia. Others, including a single nucleotide polymorphism that replaces aspartic acid (D) at residue 216 with histidine (H) in 12% of normal alleles and two other rare deletions, have not been clearly associated with disease. To gain insight into how these sequence variations affect torsinA, we used the structure of the related protein ClpB to provide a model of torsinA's AAA+ domain. Motifs important for ATP hydrolysis-sensor 1 and sensor 2-were identified, mutagenized and used to validate predictions of this model. Inspection revealed that the DeltaGAG deletion associated with dystonia removes one residue from an alpha-helix in the C-terminal portion of the AAA+ domain. The resulting distortion in torsinA structure may underlie this mutant's known tendency to produce ER-derived inclusions as well as its proposed loss of function. The D/H polymorphism at residue 216 falls in the N-terminal portion of the AAA+ domain near the sensor 1 motif. Surprisingly, cells expressing torsinA with the polymorphic histidine developed inclusions similar to those associated with DeltaGAG-torsinA, indicating that this change may also affect torsinA structure. Introducing H216 into DeltaGAG-torsinA reduced its tendency to form inclusions, suggesting that the two changes offset each other. Our findings point to a structural basis for the defects associated with the disease-linked DeltaGAG deletion in torsinA. They also suggest possible connections between the allelic polymorphism at residue 216 and the penetrance of DYT1 dystonia, as well as a possible role for this polymorphism in related disease states.""","""2006""","[""dystonia"", ""h polymorphism at residue 216"", ""atp"", ""clpb"", ""aspartic acid (d) at residue 216"", ""torsion dystonia"", ""torsina."", ""dyt1"", ""torsina""]"

Co-immune precipitation studies revealed association between vimentin and torsinA in a complex including other cytoskeletal elements, actin and tubulin, as well as two proteins previously shown to interact with torsinA-the motor protein, kinesin light chain 1, and the nuclear envelope protein, LAP1. Morphologic and functional differences related to vimentin were noted in primary fibroblasts from patients carrying this DYT1 mutation as compared with controls, including an increased perinuclear concentration of vimentin and a delayed rate of adhesion to the substratum. Overexpression of mutant torsinA inhibited neurite extension in human neuroblastoma cells, with torsinA and vimentin immunoreactivity enriched in the perinuclear region and in cytoplasmic inclusions.

The dystonia-plus group is defined by the association of parkinsonism (dopa-responsive-dystonia and rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism) or myoclonus (myoclonus-dystonia). Dopa-responsive-dystonia is a heterogeneous group with several causes (GCH1 mutations, compound mutations in GCH1, mutations in TH gene, or in 6-PTS gene). Differential diagnosis could be juvenile parkinsonism (parkin mutations). Epsilon-sarcoglycan mutation accounts for a sub-group of myoclonus-dystonia, but other genes are still unidentified. The vast majority of dystonia are sporadic and still unexplained. Functional imaging may bring new insights in disease mechanisms.

METHODS:Initially, 100 German patients and 100 matched control subjects were investigated. A second French population with 121 F-ITD patients and matched control subjects was also studied. RESULTS:Two polymorphisms of the beta-cystathionine synthase gene were associated with F-ITD in the German population, but this finding was not replicated in a second independent F-ITD patient and control group of French origin. None of the other investigated polymorphisms was associated with F-ITD. The authors failed to confirm a previously reported association with a polymorphism in DRD5.

LOCUS DYT-1 PRIMARY DYSTONIA: Locus DYT1, situated on chromosome 9, is responsible for the most common phenotypic expression of generalized primary dystonia, Ziehen-Oppenheim disease. This autosomal dominant disease has variable penetration. It has long been recognized that some individuals in families with typical disease only have segmentary, multifocal or even focal dystonia. It has been proven by molecular genetics that the disease can be expressed simply by familial writers cramp with particularly early, and often bilateral, onset. The mutation concerns the torsine A gene, whose function remains to be elucidated. Torsine A is found in the central nervous system, particularly in the dopaminergic neurons of the locus niger. GENERALIZED PRIMARY DYSTONIA UNRELATED TO DYT-1: These dystonias are phenotypically different: younger and more variable age at onset, focal localization early in the disease course generally involving the cervical or cephalic pole, less severe course. Certain forms are linked to chromosome 8 (locus DYT 6). PRIMARY FOCAL OR SEGMENTARY DYSTONIAS: These primary dystonias cause functional or postural disorders and were long considered as sporadic despite rare familial cases suggesting a genetic factor. When searched for systematically, familial cases are found in 20 to 30% of the cases. The dystonia is transmitted by dominant autosomal heredity with reduced penetration. Phenotypically, expression is heterogeneous with a constant frequency of unrecognized or neglected forms and of postural forms. One form is known to be linked to chromosome 18 (locus DYT 7). DOPA-RESPONSIVE DYSTONIA: This class represents 5 to 10% of childhood dystonias. The phenotypic expression is polymorphous but symptoms always improve with very small doses of L-dopa. Both sporadic, and more frequently familial, cases are described. Some forms are recessive, caused by mutation of the gene coding for tyrosine hydroxylase, others are autosomal dominant, often linked to mutation of the gene coding for GTP cyclohydrolase.

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been used only since a few years in dystonia patients. This review summarizes the available data on pallidal and thalamic DBS for various dystonic syndromes. The major advantage of DBS as compared to radiofrequency lesioning is that it allows performing contemporaneous bilateral surgery with relatively low morbidity in these patients. The posteroventral lateral globus pallidus internus (GPi) has been the preferred target in most instances, thus far. While phasic dystonic movements may improve early after surgery, the response of tonic dystonic movements to chronic stimulation may be delayed. The most beneficial results have been achieved in patients with primary genetic generalized and segmental dystonia, myoclonic dystonia, and complex cervical dystonia. Outcome has been varied in patients with other dystonic disorders, in particular those with secondary dystonia. Most studies have reported on relatively short follow-up periods, on single cases, or were retrospective. Pallidal DBS has been shown to be effective in complex cervical dystonia yielding both symptomatic and functional benefit for up to 2.5 years of follow-up. Dramatic improvement has been obtained in children and in adults with DYT1 positive dystonia. Also, patients with non DYT1 genetic dystonia achieved sustained benefit for up to 2 years of follow-up. Preliminary experience indicates that choreoathetosis in patients with cerebral palsy responds less well to pallidal DBS, and that it may not be effective at all in some patients. In single instances unilateral pallidal DBS has been shown to yield valuable benefit in patients with hemidystonia. The experience with DBS for treatment of Meige syndrome and other focal dystonias has been explored only recently. There is much less experience with thalamic DBS for dystonia.

This autosomal dominant neurologic disorder is characterized by abnormal movements, believed to originate from neuronal dysfunction in the basal ganglia of the human brain. The torsins (torsinA and torsinB) are members of the \""ATPases associated with a variety of cellular activities\"" (AAA(+)) superfamily of proteins that mediate chaperone and other functions involved in conformational modeling of proteins, protection from stress, and targeting of proteins to cellular organelles. In this study, the intracellular localization and levels of endogenous torsin were evaluated in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells following differentiation and stress. TorsinA, apparent MW 37 kDa, cofractionates with markers for the microsomal/endoplasmic reticulum (ER) compartment and appears to reside primarily within the ER lumen based on protease resistance. TorsinA immunoreactivity colocalizes with the lumenal ER protein protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) and extends throughout neurites. Levels of torsinA did not increase notably in response to nerve growth factor-induced differentiation. None of the stress conditions tested, including heat shock and the unfolded protein response, affected torsinA, except for oxidative stress, which resulted in an increase in the apparent MW of torsinA and redistribution to protrusions from the cell surface. These findings are consistent with a relatively rapid covalent modification of torsinA in response to oxidative stress causing a change in state.

The results are briefly compared with those reported for DBS in DYT1 dystonia (Oppenheim dystonia), which is caused by the DYT1 gene. METHODS: Enrollment in this prospective expanded pilot study was limited to adult patients with severely disabling, medically refractory non-DYT1 generalized dystonia or choreoathetosis. Six consecutive patients underwent follow-up examinations at defined intervals of 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years postsurgery. There were five women and one man, and their mean age at surgery was 45.5 years. Formal assessments included both the Burke-Fahn-Marsden dystonia scale and the recently developed Unified Dystonia Rating Scale. Two patients had primary generalized non-DYT1 dystonia, and four suffered from choreoathetosis secondary to infantile cerebral palsy. Bilateral quadripolar DBS electrodes were implanted in all instances, except in one patient with markedly asymmetrical symptoms. There were no adverse events related to surgery. The Burke-Fahn-Marsden scores in the two patients with generalized dystonia improved by 78 and 71% at 3 months, by 82 and 69% at 1 year, and by 78 and 70% at 2 years postoperatively. This was paralleled by marked amelioration of disability scores. The mean improvement in Burke-Fahn-Marsden scores in patients with choreoathetosis was 12% at 3 months, 29% at 1 year, and 23% at 2 years postoperatively, which was not significant. Two of these patients thought that they had achieved marked improvement at 2 years postoperatively, although results of objective evaluations were less impressive. In these two patients there was a minor but stable improvement in disability scores. All patients had an improvement in pain scores at the 2-year follow-up review. Medication was tapered off in both patients with generalized dystonia and reduced in two of the patients with choreoathetosis. All stimulation-induced side effects were reversible on adjustment of the DBS settings. Energy consumption of the batteries was considerably higher than in patients with Parkinson disease. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic pallidal DBS is a safe and effective procedure in generalized non-DYT1 dystonia, and it may become the procedure of choice in patients with medically refractory dystonia.

We assessed intracortical inhibition (ICI), intracortical facilitation (ICF), the cortical silent period (SP) and spinal reciprocal inhibition (RI) in 10 manifesting DYT1 gene carriers (MDYT1), seven non-manifesting DYT1 gene carriers (NMDYT1) and 13 healthy controls.

A 3-base pair (GAG) deletion in the DYT1 gene is held responsible for most cases of early-onset primary generalized dystonia in the Ashkenazi Jewish population as well as in non-Jewish patients.<h4>Objectives</h4>To investigate the prevalence of the GAG deletion in the DYT1 gene and the phenotypic variability in the general population by testing patients with different subtypes of dystonia from 4 different movement disorder outpatient clinics in Germany.<h4>Methods</h4>Two hundred fifty-six patients were tested for the GAG deletion mutation in the DYT1 gene by means of published primers and polymerase chain reaction amplification to determine GAG deletion status.<h4>Results</h4>Six of the 256 patients did carry the GAG-deletion in the DYT1 gene. However, only 2 of the 6 mutation carriers presented with what is thought to represent classic features of early-onset primary generalized dystonia. The DYT1 mutation was also detected in 2 patients with multifocal dystonia, 1 of them presenting with involvement of cranial and cervical muscles, and in 2 patients with writer's cramp of both hands with only slight progression. Our findings demonstrate that the mutation may be associated with not only generalized but also segmental and multifocal forms of dystonia.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our data underline the wide range of phenotypic variability of the DYT1 mutation.

Using (GT)n and RFLP markers in this region, we have identified obligate recombination events in some of these Jewish families, which further delineate the area containing the DYT1 gene to a 6-cM region bounded by loci AK1 and ASS. In 52 unrelated, affected Ashkenazi Jewish individuals, we have found highly significant linkage disequilibrium between a particular extended haplotype at the ABL-ASS loci and the DYT1 gene. The 4/A12 haplotype for ABL-ASS is present on 69% of the disease-bearing chromosomes among affected Jewish individuals and on only 1% of control Jewish chromosomes (chi 2 = 91.07, P much less than .001). The allelic association between this extended haplotype and DYT1 predicts that these three genes lie within 1-2 cM of each other; on the basis of obligate recombination events, the DYT1 gene is centromeric to ASS. Furthermore, this allelic association supports the idea that a single mutation event is responsible for most hereditary cases of dystonia in the Jewish population. Of the 53 definitely affected typed, 13 appear to be sporadic, with no family history of dystonia. However, the proportion of sporadic cases which potentially carry the A12 haplotype at ASS (8/13 [62%]) is similar to the proportion of familial cases with A12 (28/40 [70%]). This suggests that many sporadic cases are hereditary, that the disease gene frequency is greater than 1/15,000, and that the penetrance is lower than 30%, as previously estimated in this population. Most affected individuals were heterozygous for the ABL-ASS haplotype, a finding supporting autosomal dominant inheritance of the DYT1 gene. The ABL-ASS extended-haplotype status will provide predictive value for carrier status in Jewish individuals.

In the present study, we show that the antihistamine properties of diphenhydramine may contribute to its beneficial effects. Acute dystonic reactions were produced in rats with unilateral microinjection of haloperidol into the red nucleus as previously described. Similar to the pattern in humans, this effect could be attenuated by coadministration of diphenhydramine. Unilateral microinjection of histamine itself into the rat red nucleus produced dystonic postures (torticollis) in a dose-dependent manner, demonstrating that a histamine dysfunction could contribute to the pathophysiology of dystonia. The torticollis produced by histamine could be significantly attenuated with coadministration of the H1 antagonists diphenhydramine or pyrilamine or the H2 antagonist cimetidine. These effects are thought to be mediated through the red nucleus because significantly more torticollis was observed when histamine was injected into the red nucleus rather than surrounding mid-brain areas, the substantia nigra, or the lateral ventricle. The present data, taken together with studies in humans, suggest the involvement of histamine in some types of dystonia.

Subject scores for this profile correlated significantly with Fahn-Marsden disease severity ratings (r = 0.67, P < 0.02). In contrast to parkinsonism, lentiform and thalamic metabolism were dissociated in dystonia. We conclude that ITD is characterized by relative metabolic overactivity of the lentiform nucleus and premotor cortices. The presence of lentiform thalamic metabolic dissociation suggests that in this disorder hyperkinetic movements may arise through excessive activity of the direct putameno-pallidal inhibitory pathway.""","""1995""","[""hyperkinetic movements"", ""dystonia"", ""parkinsonism"", ""fahn-marsden disease"", ""hypermetabolism"", ""glucose"", ""patients"", ""itd"", ""fdg"", ""[18f]fluorodeoxyglucose"", ""idiopathic torsion dystonia""]"

The velocity profiles differed from those of neurologically healthy subjects by being less symmetric. In several patients movement execution was slow due to a longer deceleration time. This phenomenon was even more conspicuous in the absence of visual feedback from the limb and was accompanied by a significant decrease in the final accuracy. These findings show that patients with ITD have deficits in central motor mechanisms beyond abnormal muscle activation patterns.

Scans were performed twice: once in wakefulness and once following sleep induction. The authors used statistical parametric mapping to compare glucose metabolism between patients with EB and control subjects in each condition. They also quantified the expression of the previously identified ITD-related metabolic networks in each subject in both conditions.<h4>Results</h4>With active involuntary movements during wakefulness, the EB group exhibited hypermetabolism of the cerebellum and pons. With movement suppression during sleep, the EB group exhibited superior-medial frontal hypometabolism in a region associated with cortical control of eyelid movement. Network analysis demonstrated a specific metabolic covariance pattern associated with ITD was also expressed in the patients with EB in both the sleep and wake conditions.<h4>Conclusion</h4>These findings suggest that the clinical manifestations of EB are associated with abnormal metabolic activity in the pons and cerebellum, whereas the functional substrate of the disorder may be associated with abnormalities in cortical eyelid control regions.

We studied a genetically homogeneous group of 41 subjects with the 460InsA mutation in FTL1, documenting the presentation, clinical course, biochemistry and neuroimaging. The mean age of onset was 39.4 years (SD = 13.3, range 13-63), beginning with chorea in 50%, focal lower limb dystonia in 42.5% and parkinsonism in 7.5%. The majority reported a family history of a movement disorder often misdiagnosed as Huntington's disease. The disease progressed relentlessly, becoming generalized over a 5-10 year period, eventually leading to aphonia, dysphagia and severe motor disability with subcortical/frontal cognitive dysfunction as a late feature. A characteristic action-specific facial dystonia was common (65%), and in 63% there was asymmetry throughout the disease course. Serum ferritin levels were low in the majority of males and post-menopausal females, but within normal limits for pre-menopausal females. MR brain imaging was abnormal on all affected individuals and one presymptomatic carrier. In conclusion, isolated parkinsonism is unusual in neuroferritinopathy, and unlike Huntington's disease, cognitive changes are absent or subtle in the early stages.

Seventeen children were classified with primary dystonia: mean age 12 years 11 months, SD 4 years 6 months range 4 years 6 months to 17 years 3 months; 28 as having secondary-static dystonia: mean age 10 years 2 months, SD 4 years 9 months (range 3y 3mo-20y); five as having secondary-progressive dystonia: mean age 8 years 11 months, SD 3 years 9 months (range 5y 5mo-13y 1mo); and 13 as having NBIA dystonia: mean age 10 years 2 months, SD 3 years 11 months (range 1-14y). Children with primary dystonias demonstrated greater improvements in BFMDRS motor score than those in the other aetiological categories (Kruskal-Wallis test, p<0.001), which correlated negatively with dystonia duration and more strongly still against the ratio of dystonia duration normalized to age at surgery (DD/AS ratio) at 1 year (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient 0.4752 and -0.599 respectively). A similar significant negative correlation was found in the secondary-static dystonia group between outcome at 1 year and DD/AS ratio (-0.461). Poorer outcome in secondary dystonia coincided with the absence of a period of normal motor development in comparison with the primary dystonia group. A significant improvement in BFMDRS motor score was seen in the NBIA group at 6, but not 12 months (Wilcoxon signed rank test p=0.028, p=0.85 respectively).

Primary dystonia includes syndromes in which dystonia is the sole phenotypic manifestation with the exception that tremor can be present as well. Primary dystonias are typically mobile and may show task specificity. Fixed dystonias are often psychogenic or associated with complex regional pain syndrome. Fixed dystonia may also be the terminal consequence of long-standing, inadequately-treated, severe appendicular or cervical dystonia. The vast majority of primary dystonias have their onset in adults. Late-onset, primary, focal dystonia, particularly blepharospasm, may spread to affect other anatomical segments. Patients with focal dystonia may also exhibit spontaneous remissions that last for years. Although sensory tricks are commonly reported by patients with primary dystonia, they have also been described in subjects with secondary dystonia. Another important sensory aspect of dystonia is pain which is relatively common in cervical dystonia but also reported by many patients with masticatory dystonia, hand-forearm dystonia and blepharospasm.

Their prevalence is difficult to determine. In our experience 80-90% of all dystonias are primary. About 20-30% of those have a genetic background; 10-20% are secondary, with tardive dystonia and dystonia in cerebral palsy being the most common forms. If dystonia in spastic conditions is accepted as secondary dystonia, this is the most common form of all dystonia. In primary dystonias, the dystonic movements are the only symptoms. In secondary dystonias, dystonic movements result from exogenous processes directly or indirectly affecting brain parenchyma. They may be caused by focal and diffuse brain damage, drugs, chemical agents, physical interactions with the central nervous system, and indirect central nervous system effects. Dystonia-plus syndromes describe brain parenchyma processes producing predominantly dystonia together with other movement disorders. They include dopa-responsive dystonia and myoclonus-dystonia. Heredodegenerative dystonias are dystonic movements occurring in the context of other heredodegenerative disorders. They may be caused by impaired energy metabolism, impaired systemic metabolism, storage of noxious substances, oligonucleotid repeats and other processes. Pseudodystonias mimic dystonia and include psychogenic dystonia and various orthopedic, ophthalmologic, vestibular, and traumatic conditions. Unusual manifestations, unusual age of onset, suspect family history, suspect medical history, and additional signs may indicate nonprimary dystonia. If they are suspected, etiological clarification becomes necessary. Unfortunately, potential etiologies are legion. Diagnostic algorithms can be helpful. Treatment of nonprimary dystonias, with few exceptions, does not differ from treatment of primary dystonias. The most effective treatment for focal and segmental dystonias is local botulinum toxin injections. Deep brain stimulation of the globus pallidus internus is effective for generalized dystonia. Antidystonic drugs, including anticholinergics, tetrabenazine, clozapine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor agonists, are less effective and often produce adverse effects. Dopamine is extremely effective in dopa-responsive dystonia. The Bertrand procedure can be effective in cervical dystonia. Other peripheral surgery, including myotomy, myectomy, neurotomy, rhizotomy, ramizectomy, and accessory nerve neurolysis, has largely been abandoned. Central surgery other than deep brain stimulation is obsolete.

In contrast, adult-onset dystonia is relatively common, typically sporadic and usually remains focal. To date, 19 different forms of monogenic dystonia (primary dystonias and dystonia-plus syndromes) have been identified and classified as DYT loci.

Substance P, a member of the tachykinin family of neuropeptides, is a major component in the direct pathway from striatum to basal ganglia output nuclei. In the present study quantitative autoradiography was used to examine changes in neurokinin-1 (NK-1) and neurokinin-3 (NK-3) receptors in mutant dystonic hamsters (dt(sz)), a well characterized model of paroxysmal dystonia. NK-1 receptors were labeled in 10 dystonic brains and 10 age-matched controls with 3 nM [(3)H]-[Sar(9), Met(O(2))(11)]-SP. NK-3 binding sites were labeled in adjacent sections with 2.5 nM [(3)H]senktide. NK-1 binding was found to be unaltered in 27 brain areas examined. In contrast, NK-3 binding was significantly reduced in layers 4 and 5 of the prefrontal (-46%), anterior cingulate (-42%) and parietal (-45%) cortices, ventromedial thalamus (-42%) and substantia nigra pars compacta (-36%) in dystonic brains compared to controls. The latter effects may be particularly relevant in view of evidence that activation of NK-3 receptors on dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta can increase nigrostriatal dopaminergic activity. Since previous studies indicated that a reduced basal ganglia output in mutant hamsters is based on an overactivity of the direct pathway which also innervates substantia nigra pars compacta neurons, the decreased NK-3 binding could be related to a receptor down-regulation. The present finding of decreased NK-3 receptor density in the substantia nigra pars compacta, thalamic and cortical areas substantiates the hypothesis that disturbances of the basal ganglia-thalamus-cortex circuit play a critical role in the pathogenesis of paroxysmal dystonia.""","""2002""","[""[(3)h]senktide"", ""[(3)h]-[sar(9)"", "" met(o(2))(11)]-sp"", ""paroxysmal dystonia"", ""hamsters"", ""primary dystonias"", ""hamster"", ""dystonic""]"

The estimated prevalence of this syndrome is 1.4-4.5 per 100,000 inhabitants and it is more frequent in middle-aged females, whilst it is quite rare in children. Type 2 APS, which shows a pattern of autosomal dominant inheritance with low penetrance, has been associated with HLA specific DR3/DQ2 and DR4/DQ8 haplotypes.

Here we present the case of an 8-year-old girl, with a past medical history of type 1 diabetes diagnosed at the age of 3. She was taken to the Emergency Department because she complained of abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, and her blood analysis revealed a severe hyponatremia. She also had seizures as a consequence of the hyponatremia and frequent hypoglycemia. She was ultimately found to be suffering from autoimmune primary adrenal insufficiency. The combination of both mentioned conditions, type 1 diabetes and Addison's disease, in the absence of chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, made a diagnosis of type 2 APS plausible in this girl.

We hereby present the first case, to our knowledge, of ICI-DM following ICI use in a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patient. In this case, a 48-year-old man with HIV stable on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma and initiated treatment with the PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab. His lymphoma achieved complete response after 5 months. However, at month 8, he reported sudden polydipsia and polyuria. Labs revealed a glucose level of 764 mg/dL and glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of 7.1%. Low C-peptide and elevated glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65) antibody levels confirmed autoimmune DM, and he was started on insulin. Major histocompatibility complex class II genetic analysis revealed homozygous HLA DRB1*03-DQA1*0501-DQB1*02 (DR3-DQ2), which is a known primary driver of genetic susceptibility to type 1 DM. Autoimmune DM has been reported as an ICI-associated irAE. However, patients with immunocompromising conditions such as HIV are usually excluded from ICI trials. Therefore, little is known about such irAEs in this population. In this case, risk of ICI-DM as an irAE was likely increased by several factors including family history, a high-risk genetic profile, islet-related immunologic abnormalities, active lymphoma, and HIV infection with a possible immune reconstitution event. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for development of irAEs associated with ICI, particularly as use of these therapies broadens.

In this paper, a case of Guillain-Barrè syndrome (GBS) as the first manifestation of CD in a 23-month-old child is reported. Case presentation: We describe a case of CD onset with peripheral neuropathy in a 23-month-old Bulgarian boy presenting with a sudden refusal to walk and absence of deep tendon reflexes in both lower limbs. Neurological symptoms were preceded by two months of gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting, abdominal distention, and clear signs of malnutrition and weight loss. When we evaluated the child six months after the onset of the symptoms, clinical and laboratory findings showed clear signs of peripheral neuropathy associated with malnutrition. Serum deamidated gliadin and tissue transglutaminase antibodies were therefore measured. The anti-gliadin levels were more than sixteen times higher than normal and the IgA anti-transglutaminase levels were four times higher than normal. Anti-endomysium antibodies were positive, and human leukocyte antigens (HLA) II typing confirmed a genetic predisposition to CD (DQ2 positive and DQ8 negative). Given the association between the clinical evidence of the disease and the results of the celiac screening tests, a diagnosis of CD was made without biopsy confirmation of the enteropathy. The child began a restricted gluten-free diet that led to complete recovery of the peripheral neuropathy, walking, reflexes, and overall improvement after three months on the diet. Conclusion: Our case underlines the rare but possible associations between CD and peripheral neuropathy in children as an onset symptom, even in the absence of gastrointestinal manifestations, thus suggesting that CD should always be considered in the differential diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy in children. A good knowledge of the extra-intestinal manifestations of CD is essential for the rapid introduction of a gluten-free diet that could be useful for the resolution of the neurological symptoms.""","""2017""","[""gastrointestinal"", ""enteropathy"", ""celiac"", ""dq2"", ""human"", ""tissue transglutaminase"", ""deamidated gliadin"", ""weight loss"", ""malnutrition"", ""abdominal distention"", ""vomiting"", ""gastrointestinal symptoms"", ""neurological symptoms"", ""absence of"", ""gbs"", ""guillain-barre syndrome"", ""cd"", ""peripheral neuropathy"", ""celiac disease""]"

The genes that predispose to endocrine autoimmune diseases, e.g. type 1 diabetes, autoimmune thyroid diseases, and Addison's disease, i.e. DR3-DQ2 and DR4-DQ8, are also the major genetic determinants of CD, which is the best understood HLA-linked disease. Thus, up to 30% of first-degree relatives both of patients with CD and/or endocrine autoimmunity are affected by the other disease. In CD, certain gluten proteins bind with high affinity to HLA-DQ2 or -DQ8 in the small-intestinal mucosa, to activate gluten-specific T cells which are instrumental in the destruction of the resorptive villi. Here, the autoantigen tissue transglutaminase increases the T cell response by generating deamidated gluten peptides that bind more strongly to DQ2 or DQ8. Classical symptoms such as diarrhea and consequences of malabsorption like anemia and osteoporosis are often absent in patients with (screening-detected) CD, but this absence does not significantly affect these patients' incidence of endocrine autoimmunity. Moreover, once autoimmunity is established, a gluten-free diet is not able to induce remission. However, ongoing studies attempt to address how far a gluten-free diet may prevent or retard the development of CD and endocrine autoimmunity in children at risk.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The close relationship between CD and endocrine autoimmunity warrants a broader immune genetic and endocrine screening of CD patients and their relatives.""","""2015""","[""endocrine"", ""osteoporosis"", ""anemia"", ""malabsorption"", ""diarrhea"", ""tissue transglutaminase"", ""hla-linked disease"", ""dr4"", ""dq2"", ""dr3"", ""addison's disease"", ""autoimmune thyroid diseases"", ""type 1 diabetes"", ""endocrine autoimmune diseases"", ""patients"", ""rye"", ""barley"", ""wheat"", ""intestinal inflammatory disease"", ""cd"", ""endocrine autoimmunity"", ""celiac disease""]"

The disease is rare in the northern hemisphere but is more common in southern and central Africa and the Indian subcontinent. Although rare, its predominance in certain racial groups and their second generation migrants worldwide indicates a genetic as well as a geographic predisposition. The highly polymorphic human leucocyte antigens (HLA) confer genetic susceptibility to several autoimmune disorders. Therefore, a possible link between Mooren's ulcer and HLA type was investigated. METHODS:Patients (n=22) with non-infective destructive peripheral corneal inflammatory disease were recruited worldwide. Differential diagnosis confirmed Mooren's ulceration in 12 cases. HLA typing (HLA-A, B, C, DRB, DQB) was performed by serology and PCR using sequence specific primers. The patients came from varied ethnic backgrounds and their HLA typing results were compared with published data from ethnically matched control populations. RESULTS:Of the 12 patients with Mooren's ulcer, 10 (83%) were HLA-DR17(3) positive (including all nine patients of Asian, Indonesian, and black African origin), and 10 (83%) were HLA-DQ2 positive. The frequency of HLA-DR17(3) and DQ2 was higher in the Mooren's ulcer group compared to published data from ethnically matched control populations, where the expected antigen frequencies range between 5% and 40%.

Due to the strong linkage disequilibrium within the haplotype, it is difficult to determine which individual allele shows the strongest association with T1DM. Recent studies of the MIC-A gene have shown an HLA-independent association of allele A5 with T1DM and A5.1 with Addison's disease. In order to test for association of the MIC-A exon 5 polymorphism with T1DM and to further characterize risk and protection haplotypes in Basques, we typed 70 Basque families with T1DM for MIC-A exon 5 polymorphism using fluorescent PCR and electrophoresis on an ABI sequencing machine. When analyzed individually, allele A4 was associated with disease [OR = 2.93 (1.58-5.5)], while the presence of A9 conferred protection from T1DM [OR = 0.27 (0.08-0.74)]. In the context of HLA haplotypes, allele A4 was found to be associated to the F1C30-DR3-DQ2-DPB*0202 risk haplotype, both for T1DM and AFBAC alleles (P(c) = 0.0003).

One in ten type 1 diabetics have immunological markers for celiac disease (CD). But is there, conversely, an increased risk of CD for diabetics? This study was undertaken to answer this question by determining diabetes-associated antibodies and genetic factors in patients with a gluten-sensitive enteropathy (CD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: 68 patients with CD (48 females and 20 males) were investigated by determining the diabetes-associated serological marker GADA (glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies). 1A-2A (insulinoma-associated protein 2 antibodies), ICA (Islet cell antibodies) and IAA (insulin autoantibodies). Among this cohort were 60 patients up to the age of 25 years and eight adults (average age 41.7 years). In 36 of these patients the HLA was also determined. RESULTS: GADA was found in 6 patients (9%), 1A-2A in eight (12%) and IAA in 21. ICA were not demonstrated in any. Five of the CD patients were positive for several markers. One child, positive for autoantibodies already had manifest diabetes at the time of investigation. None of the patients with autoantibodies had an abnormal glucose metabolism one year later. HLA-DR3, that occurs in both CD and diabetes, was demonstrated in 78% of the patients with CD. The most common constellation, HLA-DR3-DQ2/HLA-DR7-DQ2, was found in 31%.

The response of the T-cell lines to ESAT-6 and peptides from a human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-heterogeneous group of donors suggested the presence of multiple epitopes and promiscuous recognition of the antigen.

Granulomatous infiltration of mononuclear cells around the parasitic vesicles is a hallmark of this disease; however, cytokine production by granuloma cells has never been studied. Tissue samples were taken in the periparasitic area and in the central area of the periparasitic granulomatous lesions from a patient with a progressive AE at surgery. Six pieces for each zone were incubated in culture medium with antibiotics and IL-2, together with irradiated autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells as feeder cells. After four days the dead feeder cells were removed by density gradient centrifugation. Lymphocytes were stimulated with Echinococcus multilocularis vesicular fluid antigen (Emf) or PHA to study IL-10, IFN-, and IL-4 production in the supernatant. Emf-stimulated mononuclear cells from the central part of the lesions secreted more IL-10 and less IFN-gamma than cells from the periphery of the granuloma. At the basal level, IL-10 secretion by the locally infiltrating cells was also high and this confirms at the local granuloma level our previous results obtained from cultures of circulating mononuclear cells. The present study confirms that IL-10 secretion is a key feature of the immune response against E. multilocularis in humans. The location of the cells which produce the highest amount of IL-10, those in contact with parasitic structures, suggests that the parasite itself is able to modulate the immune response of the host so that the infiltrating cells cannot participate in the effector phase of the cellular immune response.

The aim was also to determine whether the infection with Dobrava virus (DOBV) in Croatia was associated with a more severe illness than the infection with Puumala virus (PUUV).<h4>Patients and methods</h4>To evaluate the scale, case records of 62 HFRS patients hospitalized at the University Hospital for Infectious Diseases in Zagreb from 1995 till 2000 were reviewed. ELISA IgM and IgG tests were used for the detection of specific IgM and IgG antibodies to PUUV or DOBV.<h4>Discussion</h4>HFRS caused by hantaviruses is a zoonotic disease spread worldwide, posing a major public health problem of global dimensions. Recent epidemiologic studies show that almost all parts of Croatia are endemic regions for two hantaviruses, Puumala and Dobrava. The disease severity ranges from subclinical infection to severe illness with fatal outcome. Clinical picture is predominated by fever, myalgia, vomiting, hemorrhagic manifestation, visual impairment and kidney affection. There is still a lack of knowledge concerning all the parameters involved in the disease severity. Besides the type of virus and genetic material, host genes are also associated with the variable clinical course. HLA alleles B8, DR3, and DQ2 are strongly associated with severe outcome of PUUV infection, white HLA B27 allele is associated with a mild course. Whether similar genetic factors also operate in DOBV infection remains to be determined. Recently, a Croatian scale for grading the disease severity was proposed. The disease severity is graded by a scoring system (points attributed to specific clinical symptoms and laboratory findings) as 1--mild, 2--moderate, 3--severe, and 4--very severe. We found 60% of HFRS patients to be infected with PUUV and 40% with DOBV. In our study, 65% of patients infected with PUUV had mild, and 24% moderate disease. Severe and very severe disease was recorded in 11% of PUUV infected patients. In contrast, only 44% of patients infected with DOBV had mild disease, whereas 40% of patients showed a moderate clinical picture. Severe and very severe clinical picture was recorded in 16% of patients with DOBV infection. Statistical analysis showed a significant number of pa (p < 0.01) with PUUV infection to have mild disease, whereas a significant number of HFRS patients infected with DOBV had moderate (p < 0.01) and severe or very severe (p < 0.01) disease.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our results clearly indicate that in Croatia DOBV infection is associated with a more severe disease than PUUV infection. However, we confirmed previous findings that even PUUV infection could lead to a severe disease. Our initial experience in the evaluation of the proposed grading scale for disease severity demonstrated the proposed Croatian scale to be a useful tool in grading disease severity in patients infected with PUUV or DOBV.

As a pilot study, we have sought to determine the prevalence of coeliac disease in a cohort of Irish patients with sarcoidosis.<h4>Design</h4>Prospective, case-controlled study.<h4>Methods</h4>One hundred and two sarcoid patients (47 males, 55 females) from the west of Ireland and 105 (52 males, 53 females) healthy, ethnically matched, controls underwent interview and screening for coeliac disease and human leucocyte antigen typing by serology. Those with elevated anti-gliadin IgA (AGA) and/or positive endomysial antibody (EMA) were offered small intestinal biopsy.<h4>Results</h4>Three (3%) sarcoid patients had a prior diagnosis of coeliac disease. A further 12 (12%) patients and four (4%) controls had elevated AGA (P = 0.047), of whom three and one, respectively, had positive EMA. Small intestinal biopsy in 11 patients and three controls confirmed coeliac disease in one individual each, giving a prevalence of coeliac disease in patients compared with controls of 4/102 (4%) versus 1/105 (1%) (P = 0.21).

Clinical observations in liver transplantation and AIDS suggest that suppression of cellular/Th1-related immunity increases disease severity. Most of the studies have stressed a role for CD8+ T cells and for Interleukin-10 in the development of tolerance. A spontaneous secretion of IL-10 by the PBMC seems to be the immunological hallmark of patients with progressive forms of alveolar echinococcosis (AE). IL-10-induced inhibition of effector macrophages, but also of antigen-presenting dendritic cells, may be operating and allowing parasite growth and survival. The genetic correlates of susceptibility to infection with E. multilocularis are clearer in humans than in the mouse model. A significant link between MHC polymorphism and clinical presentation of AE has been shown, and the spontaneous secretion of IL-10 in patients with a progressive AE is higher in patients with the HLA DR3+, DQ2+ haplotype.

Furthermore, since methylation of the Class II transactivator (CIITA) gene may silence HLA expression in tumours, we correlated HLA allele frequencies with CIITA gene methylation and HLA-DR expression.<h4>Methods</h4>Cases and controls were matched for duration/extent of ulcerative colitis, age, ethnicity and gender, but not for primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). DNA was extracted from archived tissue blocks from 114 UC-CRC cases and 114 UC-controls. HLA-DR/DQ genotyping was performed using sequence-specific-oligonucleotide polymerase chain reaction (SSO-PCR). CIITA methylation was determined using methylation-specific PCR. HLA-DR immunohistochemistry was done following standard protocols.<h4>Results</h4>UC-CRC cases were more likely than UC-controls to carry the DR17 or DR13 alleles (p<0.0001 or p = 0.02, respectively). Although CIITA methylation did not vary significantly between cases and controls, DR17 and DQ2 were associated with CIITA methylation (p = 0.04 and 0.02, respectively). UC-controls more frequently carried the DR7, DR1 or DQ5 alleles (p = 0.002, 0.05 or 0.01, respectively). After adjusting for PSC, DR17 remained significantly associated with an increased risk for UC-CRC while DR7 and DQ5 remained protective.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We report a significant association between specific HLA alleles and either the risk for (DR17) or protection from (DR7, DQ5) UC-CRC. This suggests a possible genetic predisposition for increased UC-CRC risk. In addition, DQ2 and DR17 were associated with CIITA methylation.""","""2009""","[""ulcerative colitis"", ""dr1"", ""dq2"", ""psc"", ""primary sclerosing cholangitis"", ""tumours"", ""ciita"", ""class ii transactivator"", ""uc-crc"", ""uc"", ""hla"", ""crc"", ""patients"", ""colorectal cancer""]"

The main protein of wheat gluten is called gliadin, the similar proteins of rye and barley are secalin and hordein, respectively. Approximately 96% of CD patients express the HLA molecule DQ2, while the remainder mostly express the less common haplotype DQ8, reflecting the pivotal role of these molecules in the pathogenesis of CD. Because of their aminoacid sequence and tri-dimensional structure, gluten peptides selectively bind to these HLA alleles present on the surface of antigen presenting cells and then they are presented to the T lymphocytes in intestinal mucosa, thus starting the inflammatory immune response. CD is defined by the characteristic histological changes of small bowel mucosa: villous atrophy, crypts hyperplasia and T cells infiltration of the lamina propria, along with the increase of the number of intra-epithelial lymphocytes. The withdrawal of the gluten- containing food from the diet determines a complete recovery of the intestinal mucosa, whereas the reintroduction causes a relapse of the disease. This review focuses on the description of gluten peptides that elicit the mucosal immune response via the activation of innate and adaptive immunity in CD. It also describes the antagonist gluten peptides, obtained by artificial modification of gluten T epitopes or naturally occurring in the alcohol protein fraction of a cultivar of durum wheat, able to immuno-modulate the pathogenic immune response of CD.""","""2009""","[""hyperplasia"", ""villous atrophy"", ""inflammatory"", ""dq2"", ""hla"", ""patients"", ""barley"", ""rye"", ""wheat"", ""alcohol"", ""autoimmune enteropathy"", ""cd"", ""celiac disease"", ""gluten peptides"", ""toxic""]"

To test a gene complementation mechanism for these results, restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) of the DQ alpha and DQ beta genes have been related to Ro/SSA precipitins in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. In this study Ro/SSA precipitins are related to the simultaneous presence of a particular pair of RFLPs. A DQ alpha RFLP associated with HLA-DQ1 and a DQ beta RFLP associated with HLA-DQ2 predict that the alpha beta heterodimer in HLA-DQ1/DQ2 heteroxygotes is most closely related to anti-Ro/SSA autoantibodies, thereby supporting a gene complementation mechanism. Beyond this effect, an RFLP associated with HLA-DQ2 and/or DR7 is also related to Ro/SSA precipitins. Multiple molecular histocompatibility mechanisms are implicated, therefore, in the production of anti-Ro/SSA autoantibodies in autoimmune disease. For anti-Ro/SSA autoantibodies in SLE, and perhaps more generally, these data show that the histocompatibility antigens are among the elements that confer autoimmune response specificity and restrict the production of particular autoantibodies among patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.""","""1990""","[""sle"", ""autoimmune disease"", ""patients"", ""ro/ssa"", ""dq beta"", ""arthritis rheum"", ""dq2"", ""systemic lupus erythematosus"", ""anti-ro/ssa"", ""man""]"

Furthermore, in a pilot study we have shown an increase in the frequency of C4 null alleles and suggested that all the reported HLA alleles could reflect association with a limited number of ancestral haplotypes (AHs). On this occasion, we studied 122 Caucasoid patients classified according to Centers for Disease Control (CDC) criteria. The control group consisted of 67 seronegative homosexual or bisexual males at risk of developing HIV infection. C4 null alleles were unequivocally present in 58% of patients in CDC IV compared with 33% of the seronegative subjects (chi 2 = 5.65, p less than 0.05). Furthermore, C4 null alleles could be excluded in only 8% and 16% of CDC III and IV, respectively, but in 30% of the seronegative subjects. An increased frequency of three AHs largely accounted for the increases in C4 null and HLA alleles. To examine the role of specific AHs we undertook a longitudinal analysis of a subgroup of 26 patients who seroconverted under observation. Seventeen of these patients were followed for 32 to 63 months. All seven patients with the 8.1 AH (A1, CW7, B8, BfS, C4AQ0, C4B1, DR3, DQ2) developed low CD4 lymphocyte counts (less than 450 x 10(6)/l) compared with only 2 of 10 patients without this haplotype (p less than 0.002).

Sequential CD4/8 ratios showed an early and progressive decline in individuals with 8.1 or 35.x.

The frequency of the extended major histocompatibility complex haplotype HLA A1, B8, DR3, DQ2 (the \""8.1\"" haplotype) is increased among patients with IgAD.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>We carried out a direct measurement of the relative risk of homozygosity of the 8.1 haplotype for IgA deficiency in a population-based sample of 117 B8, DR3 homozygous individuals.<h4>Results and discussion</h4>IgA deficiency was found to be present in 2 of 117 (1.7%) of these subjects, a figure that is concordant with estimates of relative risk from large case-control studies in the Swedish population. These data are consistent with a multiplicative model for the 8.1 haplotype contribution to IgA deficiency and contrasts with prior studies, suggesting a much higher risk for 8.1 homozygosity. Using a dense single nucleotide polymorphism marker analysis of the MHC region in HLA B8, DR3, DQ2 homozygous individuals, we did not observe consistent differences between cases (n = 26) and controls (n = 24). Overall, our results do not support the hypothesis that IgA deficiency is associated with a distinct subgroup of 8.1 related haplotypes, but rather indicate that risk is conferred by the common 8.1 haplotype acting in multiplicative manner.""","""2009""","[""patients"", ""dq2"", ""hla a1"", "" b8"", ""primary immunodeficiency"", ""iga"", ""igad"", ""selective iga deficiency"", ""dr3"", ""mhc"", ""iga deficiency""]"

The complex genomic landscape of the MHC, notably strong linkage disequilibrium, has made resolving causal variants very challenging. A promising approach is to investigate gene expression levels considered as tractable intermediate phenotypes in mapping complex diseases. However, how transcription varies across the MHC, notably relative to specific haplotypes, remains unknown. Here, using an original hybrid tiling and splice junction microarray that includes alternate allele probes, we draw the first high-resolution strand-specific transcription map for three common MHC haplotypes (HLA-A1-B8-Cw7-DR3, HLA-A3-B7-Cw7-DR15, and HLA-A26-B18-Cw5-DR3-DQ2) strongly associated with autoimmune diseases including type 1 diabetes, systemic lupus erythematosus, and multiple sclerosis. We find that haplotype-specific differences in gene expression are common across the MHC, affecting 96 genes (46.4%), most significantly the zing finger protein gene ZFP57. Differentially expressed probes are correlated with polymorphisms between haplotypes, consistent with cis effects that we directly demonstrate for ZFP57 in a cohort of healthy volunteers (P = 1.2 × 10(-14)). We establish that alternative splicing is significantly more frequent in the MHC than genome-wide (72.5% vs. 62.1% of genes, P ≤ 1 × 10(-4)) and shows marked haplotypic differences. We also unmask novel and abundant intergenic transcription involving 31% of transcribed blocks identified.

Therefore, our results in adult ALL were similar to childhood ALL addressing DQ5 allele carriers, which showed an increase in both age groups.

Understanding the mechanisms by which tolerance to specific dietary antigens is attained and maintained is crucial to our understanding of the pathogenesis of diseases related to intolerance of specific dietary antigens. Two diseases that are the result of intolerance to a dietary antigen are celiac disease (CD) and dermatitis herpetiformis (DH). Both of these diseases are dependent upon the ingestion of gluten (the protein fraction of wheat, rye, and barley) and manifest in the gastrointestinal tract and skin, respectively. These gluten-sensitive diseases are two examples of how devastating abnormal immune responses to a ubiquitous food can be. The well-recognized risk genotype for both is conferred by either of the HLA class II molecules DQ2 or DQ8. However, only a minority of individuals who carry these molecules will develop either disease. Also of interest is that the age at diagnosis can range from infancy to 70-80 years of age. This would indicate that intolerance to gluten may potentially be the result of two different phenomena. The first would be that, for various reasons, tolerance to gluten never developed in certain individuals, but that for other individuals, prior tolerance to gluten was lost at some point after childhood. Of recent interest is the concept of non-celiac gluten sensitivity, which manifests as chronic digestive or neurologic symptoms due to gluten, but through mechanisms that remain to be elucidated.

The presence of human leukocyte antigen alleles DQ2, DQ8, or both is essential for the development of celiac disease, and can be a useful genetic test in select instances. Treatment of celiac disease is a gluten-free diet. Dietary education should focus on identifying hidden sources of gluten, planning balanced meals, reading labels, food shopping, dining out, and dining during travel.

Mortality may reach up to 40% in these infections. Hantavirus subtypes (Sin Nombre, Hantaan, Seoul, Puumala, Dobrava, etc) with different virulences represent one of the most significant factors affecting the mortality. Additionally, many other factors including age, gender, humoral immune response, genetic factors, patient's clinical and laboratory findings, transfusion, mechanical ventilation requirement, antiviral treatment and immunotherapy administered to the patient are prognostically important. Increasing age had an unfavorable effect on mortality. While the disease is commonly observed in the male gender, mortality rate is higher in the female gender. The higher the emergent neutralizing antibody response, the virus spread, the number of the infected cells and the cytotoxic T lymphocyte-mediated injury will be lower. The requirement for dialysis is reported to be higher with a poorer prognosis in individuals with HLA-B8, -DR3, -DQ2 alleles, and those with HLA-B27 allele usually experience a milder clinical course. Clinically, the risk of mortality increases in patients with multiple, central nervous system hemorrhage, sepsis, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and secondary infection. The presence of adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the requirement for mechanical ventilation, the presence of dyspnea and hemoconcentration in HPS are reported to be the most important prognostic factors associated with death. The correlation of severity and the transfusion requirement with mortality was demonstrated. High serum levels of white blood cells, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine phophokinase (CPK), C-reactive protein (CRP), prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), D-dimer and INR (International normalized ratio) are prognostic factors that increase the mortality risk.

"""21907099""","""Genetics and pharmacological treatment of dystonia.""","""Dystonia consists of involuntary repetitive twisting (torsion) or directional movements, sometimes leading to sustained postures. The movements are stereotyped and characterized by co-contraction of agonist and antagonist muscles. There is a broad clinical spectrum of dystonia which derives in part from the differential distribution of involvement. Dystonia may be localized, affecting a single body region, or generalized, affecting multiple extremities along with the trunk. Intermediate dystonic involvement can be described as segmental, designating two affected contiguous body regions, or multifocal, designating two or more noncontiguous affected body regions. Hemidystonia refers to dystonia affecting only one side of the body. Dystonia can also be categorized by age of onset and etiology. Early onset dystonia, occurring in childhood or adolescence (in some studies younger than 26 years old), is associated with more progressive disease [Greene et al. (1995). Mov. Disord. 10, 143]. In this age group, dystonia usually first appears in a limb and then spreads to involve other limbs and axial muscles; some early-onset patients may have involvement of laryngeal and other cranial muscles. Adult or late-onset dystonia typically begins in the neck, arm, or cranial muscles. Compared to early-onset dystonia, the area of involvement is more likely to remain focal or segmental. Dystonia can be considered either primary or nonprimary. Primary torsion dystonia (PTD), historically called dystonia musculorum deformans and Oppenheim's dystonia, describes dystonia in isolation, excepting tremor, without brain degeneration and without an identified acquired cause. Nonprimary or secondary dystonia encompasses a heterogeneous group of syndromes and etiologies including inherited (with or without brain degeneration), acquired, and complex neurological disorders. Monogenic forms of dystonia are labeled DYT and enumerated in the order in which they were discovered. The current 20 DYT loci comprise a heterogeneous group of disorders. (Table I) They can be divided into PTDs, dystonia-plus syndromes without brain degeneration, dystonia-parkinsonism with brain degeneration (i.e. DYT3), and paroxysmal dyskinesias. There are many neurodegenerative genetic disorders that share dystonia as a common feature of disease (Table II).

We present a historical review of early reports and illustrations of geste antagoniste.<h4>Results</h4>In 1894, Brissaud described this phenomenon in Paris in patients with torticollis. He noted that a violent muscular contraction could be reversed by a minor voluntary action. He considered the improvement obtained by what he called \""simple mannerisms, childish behaviour or fake pathological movements\"" was proof of the psychogenic origin of what he named mental torticollis. This concept was supported by photographical illustrations of the patients. The term geste antagoniste was used by Brissaud's pupils, Meige and Feindel, in their 1902 monograph on movement disorders. Other reports and illustrations of this sign were published in Europe between 1894 and 1906. Although not mentioned explicitly, geste antagoniste was also illustrated in a case report of generalized dystonia in Oppenheim's 1911 seminal description of dystonia musculorum deformans in Berlin.<h4>Discussion</h4>Brissaud-Meige's misinterpretation of the geste antagoniste unfortunately anchored the psychogenic origin of dystonia for decades. In New York, Herz brought dystonia back into the realm of organic neurology in 1944. Thereafter, it was given prominence by other authors, notably Fahn and Marsden in the 1970-1980s. Nowadays, neurologists routinely investigate for geste antagoniste when a dystonic syndrome is suspected, because it provides a further argument in favor of dystonia. The term alleviating maneuver was proposed in 2014 to replace sensory trick or geste antagoniste.

In cases of adult onset dystonia, genetic factors are less likely (Eldrige, 1970). Although dystonic movement disorders have been presumed to originate from dysfunction of the basal ganglia, examination of the brains of patients who have died with idiopathic or hereditary dystonia musculorum deformans have revealed no consistent neuropathological or neurochemical abnormalities (Zeman, 1970). Furthermore, therapy of value in the treatment of other basal ganglia disorders, in these conditions, has not been helpful (Fahn, 1982). The following paper will discuss evidence implicating deranged hypothalamic neuropeptidergic functions in dystonia.

The typical diurnal fluctuation of symptoms was not observed in 7 children. Significant differences in this respect were noted among affected siblings. There were 9 sporadic and 11 familial cases. The pedigrees observed do not contradict nor clearly confirm Segawa's hypothesis that this might be a dominantly inherited disorder with low penetrance. Response to low doses of L-Dopa was usually dramatic, the benefit was maintained over periods ranging from one to eight years without complications. Recurrence of symptoms on withdrawal was observed in all cases in which it was attempted. These cases represent a form of progressive, presumably hereditary, childhood dystonia, similar to that originally described in Japan and different from dystonia musculorum deformans. The absence of fluctuations of symptoms despite good L-Dopa response and the great variability in the severity of the disorder were important features which will require further study as will the homogeneity of the syndrome, the mode of genetic transmission and the need for persistent L-Dopa treatment in adult life.""","""1986""","[""dystonia musculorum deformans"", ""dominantly inherited disorder"", ""axial dystonia"", ""l-dopa"", ""dystonia"", ""segawa's syndrome"", ""progressive dystonia"", ""dopa""]"

In 1997, a different mutation and genetic mechanism was discovered in a severe type of generalized primary torsion dystonia - Oppenheim's dystonia. Before this, only the genetic cause for rare metabolic dystonias was known, notably dopa-responsive (Segawa's) dystonia. In the same year, from the identification of mutation in the alpha-synuclein gene in rare pedigrees with autosomal dominant parkinsonism, arose the concept that Parkinson's disease may be part of a broader group of 'synucleinopathies', in which there is a fundamental defect in protein processing. In the following year, mutations in autosomal recessive juvenile onset parkinsonism were found in a gene called 'parkin'. Parkin mutations are a more common cause of parkinsonism than the rare alpha-synuclein mutations, particularly in young-onset disease. However, a most important understanding, occurring in the last year, has been the relationship between the parkin gene product, alpha-synuclein and abnormal protein degradation in the cell. A unified theory of neuronal death in Parkinson's disease is emerging, pointing to potential new therapies in the future.""","""2001""","[""movement disorders"", ""neuronal death"", ""parkinsonism"", ""parkin"", ""autosomal recessive juvenile onset parkinsonism"", ""synucleinopathies"", ""parkinson's disease"", ""autosomal dominant parkinsonism"", ""alpha-synuclein"", ""dopa-responsive (segawa's) dystonia"", ""metabolic dystonias"", ""oppenheim's dystonia"", ""primary torsion dystonia"", ""inherited ataxias"", ""chromosome 4""]"

Clinical symptoms were evaluated before and 3-12 months after surgery using the Burke-Fahn-Marsden (BFM) dystonia rating scale for primary torsion dystonia and the Tsui scale for cervical dystonia. The Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) was completed by each patient to document preoperative and postoperative health status. Also, neurological status was documented by video before and during chronic stimulation. Magnetic resonance imaging studies were performed to show the anatomical localization of the electrode leads. Five patients showed a progressive improvement within 7 days. One patient with cervical dystonia and Meige's syndrome showed no improvement for 3 months, but beneficial effects were observed after 12 months. On average, the BFM movement scale scores decreased by 72.5% and Tsui scale scores by 63%.

Despite being a first-line testing tool for heterogeneous inherited disorders, whole-exome sequencing has not yet been evaluated in dystonia diagnostics. We set up a pilot study to address the yield of whole-exome sequencing for early-onset generalized dystonia, a disease subtype enriched for monogenic causation.<h4>Methods</h4>Clinical whole-exome sequencing coupled with bioinformatics analysis and detailed phenotyping of mutation carriers was performed on 16 consecutive cases with genetically undefined early-onset generalized dystonia. Candidate pathogenic variants were validated and tested for cosegregation. The whole-exome approach was complemented by analyzing 2 mutated yet unestablished causative genes in another 590 dystonia cases.<h4>Results</h4>Whole-exome sequencing detected clinically relevant mutations of known dystonia-related genes in 6 generalized dystonia cases (37.5%), among whom 3 had novel variants. Reflecting locus heterogeneity, identified unique variants were distributed over 5 genes (GCH1, THAP1, TOR1A, ANO3, ADCY5), of which only 1 (ANO3) was mutated recurrently. Three genes (GCH1, THAP1, TOR1A) were associated with isolated generalized dystonia, whereas 2 (ANO3, ADCY5) gave rise to combined dystonia-myoclonus phenotypes. Follow-up screening of ANO3 and ADCY5 revealed a set of distinct variants of interest, the pathogenicity of which was supported by bioinformatics testing and cosegregation work.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our study identified whole-exome sequencing as an effective strategy for molecular diagnosis of early-onset generalized dystonia and offers insights into the heterogeneous genetic architecture of this condition. Furthermore, it provides confirmatory evidence for a dystonia-relevant role of ANO3 and ADCY5, both of which likely associate with a broader spectrum of dystonic expressions than previously thought. © 2016 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.""","""2016""","[""generalized dystonia"", ""parkinson and movement disorder"", ""dystonic"", ""myoclonus"", ""adcy5"", ""ano3"", ""tor1a"", ""thap1"", ""gch1"", ""inherited disorders"", ""dystonia""]"

Genetic mutations are being increasingly recognized as a cause of dystonia. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is one of the limited treatment options available. However, there are varying reports on its efficacy in genetic dystonias. This systematic review of the characteristics of genetic dystonias treated with DBS and their outcomes aims to aid in the evaluation of eligibility for such treatment.<h4>Methods</h4>We performed a PUBMED search of all papers related to genetic dystonias and DBS up until April 2022. In addition to performing a systematic review, we also performed a meta-analysis to assess the role of the mutation on DBS response. We included cases that had a confirmed genetic mutation and DBS along with pre-and post-operative BFMDRS.<h4>Results</h4>Ninety-one reports met our inclusion criteria and from them, 235 cases were analyzed. Based on our analysis DYT-TOR1A dystonia had the best evidence for DBS response and Rapid-Onset Dystonia Parkinsonism was among the least responsive to DBS.<h4>Conclusion</h4>While our report supports the role of genetics in DBS selection and response, it is limited by the rarity of the individual genetic conditions, the reliance on case reports and case series, and the limited ability to obtain genetic testing on a large scale in real-time as opposed to retrospectively as in many cases.""","""2024""","[""parkinsonism"", ""tor1a"", ""genetic dystonias"", ""repetitive movements"", ""muscle contractions"", ""movement disorder"", ""dystonia""]"

The study compared genetically-determined cases harboring pathogenic/likely-pathogenic variants (P/LP subgroup) with the presumed idiopathic or unsolved cases.<h4>Results</h4>We recruited 65 patients (males, 69.2%) whose mean age of onset (AAO) and assessment were 25.0 ± 16.6 and 31.7 ± 15.2 years, respectively. Fifteen had pathogenic/likely-pathogenic variants (yield = 23.1%), 16 (24.6%) had variants of uncertain significance (VUS), 2 were heterozygous carriers while the remaining 32 cases tested negative (presumed idiopathic group).

The impact on DNA methylation of KMT2B variants was evaluated by analyzing the gene's characteristic episignature.<h4>Results</h4>We identified 171 carriers (109 with dystonia [9.0%]; 62 with PD [6.0%]) of 131 rare variants (minor allele frequency <0.005). A total of 52 patients (48 dystonia [4.0%]; four PD [0.4%, all with GCH1 variants]) carried 33 different (likely) pathogenic variants, of which 17 were not previously reported. Pathogenic biallelic variants in PRKRA were not found. Episignature analysis of 48 KMT2B variants revealed that only two of these should be considered (likely) pathogenic.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study confirms pathogenic variants in GCH1, GNAL, KMT2B, SGCE, THAP1, and TOR1A as relevant causes in dystonia and expands the mutational spectrum. Of note, likely pathogenic variants only in GCH1 were also found among PD patients.

PET scans from 267 children with dystonia being evaluated for possible Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) surgery between September 2007 and February 2018 at Evelina London Children's Hospital (ELCH) United Kingdom were examined. Scans without gross anatomical abnormality (e.g. large cysts, significant ventriculomegaly; n = 240) were analysed with Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM12). Glucose metabolism patterns were examined in the 144/240 (60%) cases with the ten commonest childhood-onset dystonias, focusing on nine anatomical regions. A group of thirty-nine adult controls was used for comparisons. The genetic dystonias were associated with the following genes: TOR1A, THAP1, SGCE, KMT2B, HPRT1 (Lesch Nyhan disease), PANK2 and GCDH (Glutaric Aciduria type 1). The acquired Cerebral Palsy (CP) cases were divided into those related to prematurity (CP-Preterm), neonatal jaundice/kernicterus (CP-Kernicterus) and hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (CP-Term). Each dystonia subgroup had distinct patterns of altered FDG-PET uptake. Focal glucose hypometabolism of the pallidi, putamina, or both, was the commonest finding, except in PANK2, where basal ganglia metabolism appeared normal. HPRT1 uniquely showed glucose hypometabolism across all nine cerebral regions. Temporal lobe glucose hypometabolism was found in KMT2B, HPRT1 and CP-Kernicterus. Frontal lobe hypometabolism was found in SGCE, HPRT1, and PANK2. Thalamic and brainstem hypometabolism were seen only in HPRT1, CP-Preterm and CP-term dystonia cases.

It followed MDSGene's standardized data extraction protocol and screened a total of ~1200 citations. Phenotypic and genotypic data on ~1200 patients with 254 different mutations were curated and analyzed. There were differences regarding age at onset, site of onset, and distribution of symptoms across mutation carriers in all 7 genes. Although carriers of TOR1A, THAP1, PRKRA, KMT2B, or HPCA mutations mostly showed childhood and adolescent onset, patients with GNAL and ANO3 mutations often developed first symptoms in adulthood. GNAL and KMT2B mutation carriers frequently have 1 predominant site of onset, that is, the neck (GNAL) or the lower limbs (KMT2B), whereas site of onset in DYT-TOR1A, DYT-THAP1, DYT-ANO3, DYT-PRKRA, and DYT-HPCA was broader. However, in most DYT-THAP1 and DYT-ANO3 patients, dystonia first manifested in the upper half of the body (upper limb, neck, and craniofacial/laryngeal), whereas onset in DYT-TOR1A, DYT-PRKRA and DYT-HPCA was frequently observed in an extremity, including both upper and lower ones. For ANO3, a segmental/multifocal distribution was typical, whereas TOR1A, PRKRA, KMT2B, and HPCA mutation carriers commonly developed generalized dystonia. THAP1 mutation carriers presented with focal, segmental/multifocal, or generalized dystonia in almost equal proportions. GNAL mutation carriers rarely showed generalization.

"""33247415""","""Isolated dystonia: clinical and genetic updates.""","""Four genes associated with isolated dystonia are currently well replicated and validated. DYT-THAP1 manifests as young-onset generalized dystonia with predominant craniocervical symptoms; and is associated with mostly deleterious missense variation in the THAP1 gene. De novo and inherited missense and protein truncating variation in GNAL as well as primarily missense variation in ANO3 cause isolated focal and/or segmental dystonia with preference for the upper half of the body and older ages at onset. The GAG deletion in TOR1A is associated with generalized dystonia with onset in childhood in the lower limbs. Rare variation in these genes causes monogenic sporadic and inherited forms of isolated dystonia; common variation may confer risk and imply that dystonia is a polygenic trait in a subset of cases. Although candidate gene screens have been successful in the past in detecting gene-disease associations, recent application of whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing methods enable unbiased capture of all genetic variation that may explain the phenotype. However, careful variant-level evaluation is necessary in every case, even in genes that have previously been associated with disease. We review the genetic architecture and phenotype of DYT-THAP1, DYT-GNAL, DYT-ANO3, and DYT-TOR1A by collecting case reports from the literature and performing variant classification using pathogenicity criteria.""","""2020""","[""tor1a"", ""isolated focal and/or segmental dystonia"", ""ano3"", ""gnal"", ""thap1"", ""dyt"", ""dystonia""]"

Common variants of dystonia-related genes were reported to be risk factors for idiopathic isolated dystonia. In this study, we aimed to analyse the roles of previously reported GTP cyclohydrolase (GCH1) and Torsin family 1 member A (TOR1A) polymorphisms in an Indian isolated dystonia case-control group. A total of 292 sporadic isolated dystonia patients and 316 control individuals were genotyped for single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of GCH1 (rs3759664:G > A, rs12147422:A > G and rs10483639:C > G) and TOR1A (rs13300897:G > A, rs1801968:G > C, rs1182:G > T and rs3842225:G > Δ) using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and confirmed by direct Sanger sequencing. The statistical significance of allelic, genotypic and haplotypic associations of all of the SNPs were evaluated using the two-tailed Fisher exact test. The minor allele (A) of rs3759664 is significantly associated with isolated limb dystonia as a risk factor (p = 0.005). The minor allele (C) of rs1801968 is strongly associated with isolated dystonia (p < 0.0001) and most of its subtypes. The major allele of rs3842225 (G) may act as a significant risk factor for Writer's cramp (p = 0.03). Four different haplogroups comprising of either rs1182 or rs3842225 or in combination with rs1801968 and rs13300897 were found to be significantly associated with isolated dystonia. No other allelic, genotypic or haplotypic association was found to be significant with isolated dystonia cohort or its endophenotype stratified groups. Our study suggests that TOR1A common variants have a significant role in isolated dystonia pathogenesis in the Indian population, whereas SNPs in the GCH1 gene may have a limited role.""","""2020""","[""tor1a"", ""writer's cramp"", ""isolated limb dystonia"", ""rs3842225"", ""g > t"", ""rs1182"", ""g > c"", ""rs1801968"", ""rs13300897"", ""c > g"", ""rs10483639"", ""a > g"", ""rs12147422"", ""g > a"", ""rs3759664"", ""patients"", ""torsin family 1 member a"", ""movement disorder"", ""dystonia"", ""gch1""]"

For the latter, numerous genetic associations studies have been performed with largely inconsistent results. The aim of this study was to perform a field synopsis including systematic meta-analyses of genetic association studies in isolated dystonia.<h4>Methods</h4>For the field synopsis we systematically screened and scrutinized the published literature using NCBI's PubMed database. For genetic variants with sufficient information in at least two independent datasets, random-effects meta-analyses were performed, including meta-analyses stratified by ethnic descent and dystonia subtypes.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 3575 articles were identified and scrutinized resulting in the inclusion of 42 independent publications allowing 134 meta-analyses on 45 variants across 17 genes. While our meta-analyses pinpointed several association signals with variants in TOR1A, DRD1, and ARSG, no single variant displayed compelling association with dystonia in the available data.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our study provides an up-to-date summary of the status of dystonia genetic association studies.

Autosomal dominant torsion dystonia-1 is a disease with incomplete penetrance most often caused by an in-frame GAG deletion (p.Glu303del) in the endoplasmic reticulum luminal protein torsinA encoded by TOR1A. We report an association of the homozygous dominant disease-causing TOR1A p.Glu303del mutation, and a novel homozygous missense variant (p.Gly318Ser) with a severe arthrogryposis phenotype with developmental delay, strabismus and tremor in three unrelated Iranian families. All parents who were carriers of the TOR1A variant showed no evidence of neurological symptoms or signs, indicating decreased penetrance similar to families with autosomal dominant torsion dystonia-1. The results from cell assays demonstrate that the p.Gly318Ser substitution causes a redistribution of torsinA from the endoplasmic reticulum to the nuclear envelope, similar to the hallmark of the p.Glu303del mutation. Our study highlights that TOR1A mutations should be considered in patients with severe arthrogryposis and further expands the phenotypic spectrum associated with TOR1A mutations.""","""2017""","[""tor1a"", ""patients"", ""symptoms"", ""p.gly318ser"", ""tor1a."", ""torsina"", ""p.glu303del"", ""autosomal dominant torsion dystonia-1"", ""tremor"", ""strabismus"", ""developmental delay"", ""arthrogryposis""]"

Etiological categories include primary dystonia, secondary dystonia, heredodegenerative diseases with dystonia, and dystonia plus. Primary dystonia includes syndromes in which dystonia is the sole phenotypic manifestation with the exception that tremor can be present as well. Most primary dystonia begins in adults, and approximately 10% of probands report one or more affected family members. Many cases of childhood- and adolescent-onset dystonia are due to mutations in TOR1A and THAP1. Mutations in THAP1 and CIZ1 have been associated with sporadic and familial adult-onset dystonia. Although significant recent progress had been made in defining the genetic basis for most of the dystonia-plus and heredodegenerative diseases with dystonia, a major gap remains in understanding the genetic etiologies for most cases of adult-onset primary dystonia.

It is caused by a GAG deletion in the Tor1A gene located on chromosome 9. TorsinA, the product of the Tor1A gene, is expressed throughout the brain beginning early in embryonic development. It plays a role in the regulation of nuclear envelope-cytoskeletal interactions, and presumably nuclear translocation. Since nuclear translocation, powered by cytoskeletal traction, is critical for cell proliferation and migration, we examined whether neurogenesis and neuronal migration are affected in Tor1A-/- mouse brain. Our data show that interkinetic nuclear migration and the pattern of migration of newly generated neurons are impaired in the dorsal forebrain of the Tor1A-/- embryo. However, neurogenesis is not altered significantly. The rate of migration of cells from explants of the medial ganglionic eminence is also impaired in the Tor1A-/- embryo. Thus, loss of torsinA results in subtle but significant alterations in cell proliferation and migration in the embryonic forebrain.

OBJECTIVE: To summarize current knowledge about movement disorders overrepresented among patients of Jewish ancestry.

The final reference list was generated by giving priority to articles directly related to the topic, articles with the latest information, and comprehensive but relevant reviews. FINDINGS: About one-third of patients with sporadic Parkinson disease (PD) and more than 40% of patients with familial PD of Ashkenazi Jewish descent likely carry the G2019S mutation in the LRRK2 gene, a mutation in the glucocerebrosidase (GBA) gene, or both. This finding contrasts with only a 10% frequency of these mutations in patients with PD who are of non-Jewish ancestry. A dystonia due to a TOR1A gene mutation is responsible for most early-onset autosomal dominant dystonia, and 90% of Ashkenazi Jews who develop early-onset disease have TOR1A-related dystonia. Familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis tend to cluster among Jews of North African descent, and Machado-Joseph disease is particularly frequent in Yemenite Jews. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Genetic forms of PD are much more common in patients of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry with sporadic and familial PD than in the non-Jewish population.

In addition, although emphasis has been placed on dominant isolated dystonia, the disorder is also transmitted as a recessive trait, for which no mutations have been defined. Using whole-exome sequencing in a recessive isolated dystonia-affected kindred, we identified disease-segregating compound heterozygous mutations in COL6A3, a collagen VI gene associated previously with muscular dystrophy. Genetic screening of a further 367 isolated dystonia subjects revealed two additional recessive pedigrees harboring compound heterozygous mutations in COL6A3. Strikingly, all affected individuals had at least one pathogenic allele in exon 41, including an exon-skipping mutation that induced an in-frame deletion. We tested the hypothesis that disruption of this exon is pathognomonic for isolated dystonia by inducing a series of in-frame deletions in zebrafish embryos. Consistent with our human genetics data, suppression of the exon 41 ortholog caused deficits in axonal outgrowth, whereas suppression of other exons phenocopied collagen deposition mutants. All recessive mutation carriers demonstrated early-onset segmental isolated dystonia without muscular disease. Finally, we show that Col6a3 is expressed in neurons, with relevant mRNA levels detectable throughout the adult mouse brain.

Autoradiography was used to assess the functional DAT binding in striatum. Striatal dopamine and its metabolites were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography. After nerve crush injury, we found abnormal posturing in the lesioned hindlimb of both mutant and wt mice indicating the profound influence of the nerve lesion (15x vs. 12x relative to control) resembling human peripheral pseudodystonia. In mutant mice the phenotypic abnormalities were increased by about 40 % (p < 0.05). This was accompanied by complex alterations of striatal dopamine homeostasis.

Systemic administration of amphetamine did not increase dopamine (DA) release as efficiently in these mice as compared with wild-type transgenic and non-transgenic mice. We, now, studied the contribution of the DA transporter (DAT) to amphetamine-induced DA release in hMT1 transgenic mice using in vivo no-net flux microdialysis. This method applies different concentrations of DA through the microdialysis probe and measures DA concentration at the output of the probe following an equilibrium period. The slope (extraction fraction) is the measure of the DAT activity in vivo. The slope for hMT1 transgenic mice was 0.58 +/- 0.07 and for non-transgenic animals, 0.87 +/- 0.06 (p < 0.05). We further investigated the efficacy of nomifensine (a specific DAT inhibitor) in inhibiting amphetamine-induced DA release. Local application of nomifensine 80 min before the systemic application of amphetamine inhibited DA release in both transgenic mice and their non-transgenic littermates. The efficiency of the inhibition appeared to be different, with mean values of 48% for hMT1 transgenic mice versus 84% for non-transgenic littermates. Moreover, we have evaluated basal and amphetamine-induced locomotion in hMT1 transgenic mice compared with their non-transgenic littermates, using an O-maze behavioral chamber.

In this study we examined the biogenesis of mutant torsinA-positive membrane inclusions using tetracycline-regulated herpes simplex virus amplicon vectors. At low expression levels, mutant torsinA was localized predominantly around the nucleus, while at high levels it was also concentrated within cytosolic spheroid inclusions. In contrast, the distribution of wild-type torsinA did not vary, appearing diffuse and reticular at all expression levels. These observations are consistent with descriptions of inducible membrane synthesis in other systems in which cytosolic membrane whorls are derived from multilayered membrane stacks that first form around the nuclear envelope. These results also suggest that formation of mutant torsinA-positive inclusions occurs at high expression levels in culture, whereas the perinuclear accumulation of the mutant protein is present even at low expression levels that are more likely to resemble those of the endogenous protein.

Although there is increasing evidence that dysfunction of the dopamine system is implicated in the development of EOTD, the biological function of torsinA and its relation to dopaminergic neurotransmission has remained unexplored. Here, we show that torsinA can regulate the cellular trafficking of the dopamine transporter, as well as other polytopic membrane-bound proteins, including G protein-coupled receptors, transporters, and ion channels. This effect was prevented by mutating the ATP-binding site in torsinA. The dystonia-associated torsinA deletion mutant (DeltaE-torsinA) did not have any effect on the cell surface distribution of polytopic membrane-associated proteins, suggesting that the mutation linked with EOTD results in a loss of function.

Human torsinA, mutations in which cause another movement disorder termed early-onset torsion dystonia, is highly expressed in DA neurons and is also a component of Lewy bodies.

Worm DA neurons undergo a reproducible pattern of neurodegeneration after treatment with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), a neurotoxin commonly used to model PD. Overexpression of torsins in C. elegans DA neurons results in dramatic suppression of neurodegeneration after 6-OHDA treatment. In contrast, expression of either dystonia-associated mutant torsinA or combined overexpression of wild-type and mutant torsinA yielded greatly diminished neuroprotection against 6-OHDA. We further demonstrated that torsins seem to protect DA neurons from 6-OHDA through downregulating protein levels of the dopamine transporter (DAT-1) in vivo. Additionally, we determined that torsins protect robustly against DA neurodegeneration caused by overexpression of alpha-synuclein. Using mutant nematodes lacking DAT-1 function, we also showed that torsin neuroprotection from alpha-synuclein-induced degeneration occurs in a manner independent of this transporter.

Snapin co-localized with endogenous torsinA on dense core granules in PC12 cells and was recruited to perinuclear inclusions containing mutant DeltaE-torsinA in neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells.

Knockdown of snapin and/or torsinA using small interfering RNAs had a similar inhibitory effect on the exo-endocytic process.

Further, we found that while neither form of torsinA could protect CS from heat-induced inactivation, they were both able to reactivate luciferase when ATP and rabbit reticulocyte lysate were added. This suggests that torsinA holds luciferase in an intermediate state, which can then be refolded in the presence of other chaperones.

METHODS:The study included 265 PSC patients from five European countries with a median follow-up of 9.1 years. The end-points were death (n = 38) or liver transplantation (n = 52). Thirty patients developed cholangiocarcinoma during follow-up. RESULTS:The DRB1*03,DQA1*0501, DQB1*02 (i.e. DR3,DQ2) heterozygous genotype was associated with an increased risk of death or liver transplantation (hazard ratio = 1.63; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.06-2.52). The presence of a DQ6 encoding haplotype (DQB1*0603 or DQB1*0602) in DR3,DQ2 negative individuals was associated with a reduced risk of death or liver transplantation (hazard ratio = 0.57; 95% CI = 0.36-0.88). There was a trend towards an increased risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma among DR4,DQ8 positive patients, but this did not reach significance (odds ratio = 2.27; 95% CI = 0.78-6.62). CONCLUSION:The DR3,DQ2 heterozygous genotype is associated with a more rapid progression of PSC, whereas HLA-DQ6 is associated with a retarded disease progression.

Previous studies have shown that specific DQCAR alleles are in tight linkage disequilibrium with known HLA DR-DQ haplotypes. Of special interest was the fact that haplotypes containing long CA repeat alleles (DQCAR > 111) were generally more polymorphic within and across ethnic groups. In these latter cases, several DQCAR alleles were found even in haplotypes containing the same flanking DQA1 and DQB1 alleles. In this work, three HLA class II associated diseases were studied using the DQCAR microsatellite. The aim of this study was to test if DQCAR typing could distinguish haplotypes with the same DRB1, DQA1 and DQB1 alleles in control and affected individuals. To do so, patients with selected HLA DR-DQ susceptibility haplotypes were compared with HLA DR and DQ matched controls. This included: Norwegian subjects with Celiac disease and the HLA DRB1*0301, DQA1*05011, DQB1*02 haplotype; Japanese subjects with Type 1 (insulin-dependent) Diabetes Mellitus and the HLA DRB1*0405, DQA1*0302, DQB1*0401 haplotype; and French patients with corticosensitive Idiopathic Nephrotic Syndrome and the HLA DRB1*0701, DQA1*0201, DQB1*0202 haplotype. These specific haplotypes were selected from our earlier work to include one haplotype bearing a short DQCAR allele (celiac disease and DR3,DQ2-DQCAR99) and two haplotypes bearing long DQCAR alleles (Diabetes Mellitus and DR4,DQ4-DQCAR 113 or 115 Idiopathic Nephrotic syndrome and DR7,DQ2-DQCAR 111-121). Additional DQCAR diversity was found in both control and patients bearing haplotypes with long CA repeat alleles.

Environmental factors may contribute to development of the phenotype since mutations in TOR1A are clinically penetrant in less than 40% of cases. Median age of onset is 10 and appearance of dystonia after 28 is rare. As a step towards understanding the temporal window of DYT1 disease penetrance, we have examined torsinA transcript and protein expression in rats from the embryonic period through adulthood. With relative quantitative multiplex real-time RT-PCR, we detected torsinA transcript in both neural (cerebellar cortex, striatum, cerebral cortex, thalamus and hippocampus) and non-neural (liver, kidney and heart) tissues at each developmental time point tested (embryonic day 20 [E20], postnatal day 1 [P1], P7, P14, P36, 6 months, 1.5 years). Levels of torsinA transcript were highest at E20 or P1 in all tissues examined except for the cerebellum where transcript levels peaked at P14. Early postnatal levels of torsinA transcript were over three times higher than those seen in adult rats. With quantitative radioactive in situ hybridization, torsinA transcript was widely distributed in brain at all ages with levels peaking at P14 in both cerebellum and striatum. TorsinA-immunoreactivity (IR) was present in neurons throughout the brain. TorsinA-IR was detected in perikarya, dendrites and axons but not nuclei. At P14, prominent expression of torsinA was noted in both striatal cholinergic interneurons and cerebellar Purkinje cells. Our results suggest that torsinA may contribute to postnatal maturational events in the brain such as dendritic arborization and synaptogenesis. Furthermore, the time course of torsinA expression in discrete components of motor networks is compatible with the temporal window of clinical penetrance in DYT1 mutation carriers.""","""2004""","[""rats"", ""dystonia"", ""dyt1"", ""generalized dystonia"", ""tor1a"", ""torsina"", ""rat""]"

HLA restriction and peptide binding of identified T cell epitopes to DR3 or DQ2 were determined using blocking monoclonal antibodies and a direct binding assay.<h4>Results</h4>DR3/DQ2-transgenic mice generated an unusually rapid class-switched humoral response to hLa with characteristic spreading to Ro 52 and Ro 60 proteins following hLa protein immunization. Seven T cell determinants in hLa were restricted to the HLA-DR3/DQ2 haplotype. Six epitopes tested were restricted to HLA-DR and bound DR3 with semiconserved DR3 binding motifs. No DQ restriction of these epitopes was demonstrable despite efficient DQ binding activity in some cases. No neo-T cell epitopes were identified in mutant La; however, T cells primed with mutant La exhibited a striking increase in proliferation to the epitope hLa(151-168) compared with T cells primed with hLa.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Multiple DR3-restricted epitopes of hLa have been identified.

Currently receptor subtype specific antagonists are developed for therapy, however, it is yet unknown whether the levels of targeted receptors are unaltered. In the present study, we firstly examined the expression of M1 and M4 receptors in DYT1 KI mice in comparison to wildtype mice.

Interestingly, it has been proposed that TA, by interacting with the cytoskeletal network, may contribute to the control of neurite outgrowth and/or by acting as a chaperone at synapses could affect synaptic vesicle turnover and neurotransmitter release. Accordingly, both its peculiar developmental expression in striatum and cerebellum and evidence from DYT1 knock-in mice suggest that TA may influence dendritic arborization and synaptogenesis in the brain. Therefore, to better understand TA function a detailed description of its localization at synaptic level is required. Here, we characterized by means of rigorous quantitative confocal analysis TA distribution in the mouse cerebellum at postnatal day 14 (P14), when both cerebellar synaptogenesis and TA expression peak. We observed that the protein is broadly distributed both in cerebellar cortex and in the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN). Of note, Purkinje cells (PC) express high levels of TA also in the spines and axonal terminals. In addition, abundant expression of the protein was found in the main GABA-ergic and glutamatergic inputs of the cerebellar cortex.

The aim of the study: The aim of this study was to verify the chaperone function of torsin 1A by investigating its ability to prevent the aggregation of huntingtin model peptides.<h4>Patients and methods</h4>Materials and methods: N-terminal mutant huntingtin fragments of different length were co-expressed in neuronal HT-22 and non-neuronal HeLa cells with either the wild-type or mutant (ΔE302/303) torsin 1A protein. The transfected cells were immunostained and analyzed for the presence of huntingtin aggregates using fluorescence microscopy.<h4>Results</h4>Results: The immunofluorescence analysis of huntingtin subcellular distribution within the transfected cells showed no significant difference between the huntingtin aggregation levels in cells co-expressing the wild-type torsin 1A and in control cells co-transfected with an empty vector. Instead, it was the increased level of huntingtin aggregation in the presence of the torsion dystonia-causing ΔE302/303 mutant that reached statistical significance in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Conclusions: Either torsin 1A does not function as a chaperone protein or huntingtin is not an efficient substrate for such a hypothetical chaperone activity. However, the ability of mutant torsin 1A to stimulate the accumulation of aggregation-prone polypeptides might constitute an important source of ΔE302/303 pathogenicity and thus a potential target for future therapy.""","""2018""","[""torsin 1a"", ""chaperone proteins"", ""torsion dystonia"", ""tor1a"", ""huntingtin"", ""protein aggregation""]"
"""20301665""","""DYT1 Early-Onset Isolated Dystonia""","""<h4>Clinical characteristics</h4>DYT1 early-onset isolated dystonia typically presents in childhood or adolescence and only on occasion in adulthood. Dystonic muscle contractions causing posturing or irregular tremor of a leg or arm are the most common presenting findings. Dystonia is usually first apparent with specific actions such as writing or walking. Over time, the contractions frequently (but not invariably) become evident with less specific actions and spread to other body regions. No other neurologic abnormalities are present. Disease severity varies considerably even within the same family. Isolated writer's cramp may be the only sign.<h4>Diagnosis/testing</h4>The diagnosis of DYT1 dystonia is established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous TOR1A pathogenic variant on molecular genetic testing. A TOR1A three base-pair deletion, c.907_909delGAG, is identified in most affected individuals.<h4>Management</h4>Treatment of manifestations: Oral medications, either alone or in combination, are usually tried first, including anticholinergics, baclofen, benzodiazepines, and others. Botulinum toxin injections for treatment of focal symptoms can be used in conjunction with oral medications. If oral medications and botulinum toxin injections do not provide sufficient control of symptoms, surgery enabling deep-brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus interna (GPi) should be considered. Prevention of secondary complications: Aggressive medical and surgical intervention to prevent contractures of the joints and deformities of the spine.

It is caused mainly by a heterozygous trinucleotide deletion in DYT1/TOR1A, coding for torsinA. The mutation may lead to a partial loss of torsinA function. Functional alterations of the basal ganglia circuits have been implicated in this disease. Striatal dopamine receptor 2 (D2R) levels are significantly decreased in DYT1 dystonia patients and in the animal models of DYT1 dystonia. D2R-expressing cells, such as the medium spiny neurons in the indirect pathway, striatal cholinergic interneurons, and dopaminergic neurons in the basal ganglia circuits, contribute to motor performance. However, the function of torsinA in these neurons and its contribution to the motor symptoms is not clear. Here, D2R-expressing-cell-specific Dyt1 conditional knockout (d2KO) mice were generated and in vivo effects of torsinA loss in the corresponding cells were examined. The Dyt1 d2KO mice showed significant reductions of striatal torsinA, acetylcholine metabolic enzymes, Tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA), and cholinergic interneurons. The Dyt1 d2KO mice also showed significant reductions of striatal D2R dimers and tyrosine hydroxylase without significant alteration in striatal monoamine contents or the number of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. The Dyt1 d2KO male mice showed motor deficits in the accelerated rotarod and beam-walking tests without overt dystonic symptoms. Moreover, the Dyt1 d2KO male mice showed significant correlations between striatal monoamines and locomotion. The results suggest that torsinA in the D2R-expressing cells play a critical role in the development or survival of the striatal cholinergic interneurons, expression of striatal D2R mature form, and motor performance.

First, 4-week-old (juvenile) R6/1 mice behavioral phenotype was characterized by an increased impulsive-like behavior and less aggressive-like behavior. In this line, we identified an early striatal downregulation of Foxp2 protein starting as soon as at postnatal day 15 that could explain such deficiencies. Interestingly, the rescue of striatal Foxp2 levels from postnatal stages completely reverted the impulsivity-phenotype and partially the social impairments concomitant with a rescue of dendritic spine pathology. A mass spectrometry study indicated that the rescue of spine loss was associated with an improvement of several altered proteins related with cytoskeleton dynamics.

We report an association of the homozygous dominant disease-causing TOR1A p.Glu303del mutation, and a novel homozygous missense variant (p.Gly318Ser) with a severe arthrogryposis phenotype with developmental delay, strabismus and tremor in three unrelated Iranian families. All parents who were carriers of the TOR1A variant showed no evidence of neurological symptoms or signs, indicating decreased penetrance similar to families with autosomal dominant torsion dystonia-1. The results from cell assays demonstrate that the p.Gly318Ser substitution causes a redistribution of torsinA from the endoplasmic reticulum to the nuclear envelope, similar to the hallmark of the p.Glu303del mutation.

Mutations predicted to compromise specific torsinA functional motifs showed a synthetic interaction with the ΔE mutation and destabilized torsinAΔE, suggesting that the ΔE mutation predisposes torsinA to defects in the presence of secondary insults. In this case, BiP was required for torsinAΔE degradation, consistent with data that specific chaperones exhibit either pro-degradative or pro-folding activities.

One of the most severe types of dystonia is early-onset torsion dystonia (EOTD). The best studied and validated EOTD-associated mutation, torsinAΔE, is a deletion of a C-terminal glutamate residue in the AAA+ ATPase torsinA. TorsinA appears to be an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/nuclear envelope chaperone with multiple roles in the secretory pathway and in determining subcellular architecture. Many functions are disabled in the torsinAΔE variant, and torsinAΔE is also less stable than wild-type torsinA and is a substrate for ER-associated degradation. Nevertheless, the molecular factors involved in the biogenesis and degradation of torsinA and torsinAΔE have not been fully explored. To identify conserved cellular factors that can alter torsinAΔE protein levels, we designed a new high-throughput, automated, genome-wide screen utilizing our validated <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> torsinA expression system. By analyzing the yeast non-essential gene deletion collection, we identified 365 deletion strains with altered torsinAΔE steady-state levels. One notable hit was <i>EUG1</i>, which encodes a member of the protein disulfide isomerase family (PDIs). PDIs reside in the ER and catalyze the formation of disulfide bonds, mediate protein quality control and aid in nascent protein folding. We validated the role of select human PDIs in torsinA biogenesis in mammalian cells and found that overexpression of PDIs reduced the levels of torsinA and torsinAΔE. Together, our data report the first genome-wide screen to identify cellular factors that alter expression levels of the EOTD-associated protein torsinAΔE. More generally, the identified hits help in dissecting the cellular machinery involved in folding and degrading a torsinA variant, and constitute potential therapeutic factors for EOTD.

One outstanding difference between torsinA and other AAA+ ATPases is that torsinA is a glycoprotein. TorsinA <i>N</i>-linked glycans impact torsinA biogenesis and subcellular localization. Here, we propose that torsinA glycans also modulate torsinA oligomerization properties. We used structural modeling to test this idea, and show that <i>N</i>-linked glycans appear to restrict torsinA's ability to form closed homohexameric ring assemblies, and instead promote an open hexameric conformation that allows torsinA interaction with key cofactors required for ATP hydrolysis.

During folding, there is a complex yet only partially understood interplay between disulfide bond formation, which is an enzyme catalyzed event in the oxidizing environment of the ER, along with other post-translational modifications (PTMs) and chaperone-supported protein folding. Here, we used the glycoprotein torsinA as a model substrate to explore the impact of ER redox homeostasis on PTMs and protein biogenesis. TorsinA is a AAA+ ATPase with unusual oligomeric properties and controversial functions. The deletion of a C-terminal glutamic acid residue (∆E) is associated with the development of Early-Onset Torsion Dystonia, a severe movement disorder. TorsinA differs from other AAA+ ATPases since it is an ER resident, and as a result of its entry into the ER torsinA contains two N-linked glycans and at least one disulfide bond. The role of these PTMs on torsinA biogenesis and function and the identity of the enzymes that catalyze them are poorly defined. Using a yeast torsinA expression system, we demonstrate that a specific protein disulfide isomerase, Pdi1, affects the folding and N-linked glycosylation of torsinA and torsinA∆E in a redox-dependent manner, suggesting that the acquisition of early torsinA folding intermediates is sensitive to perturbed interactions between Cys residues and the quality control machinery.

Targeting the intrinsic capacities of neuroprotective proteins to restore neuronal function and/or attenuate degeneration represents a potential means toward therapeutic intervention. The product of the human DYT1 gene, torsinA, is a member of the functionally diverse AAA+ family of proteins and exhibits robust molecular-chaperone-like activity, both in vitro and in vivo. Although mutations in DYT1 are associated with a rare form of heritable generalized dystonia, the native function of torsinA seems to be cytoprotective in maintaining the cellular threshold to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Here we explore the potential for torsinA to serve as a buffer to attenuate the cellular consequences of misfolded-protein stress as it pertains to the neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The selective vulnerability of motor neurons to degeneration in ALS mouse models harboring mutations in superoxide dismutase (SOD1) has been found to correlate with regional-specific ER stress in brains. Using Caenorhabditis elegans as a system to model ER stress, we generated transgenic nematodes overexpressing either wild-type or mutant human SOD1 to evaluate their relative impact on ER stress induction in vivo. These studies revealed a mutant-SOD1-specific increase in ER stress that was further exacerbated by changes in temperature, all of which was robustly attenuated by co-expression of torsinA. Moreover, through complementary behavioral analysis, torsinA was able to restore normal neuronal function in mutant G85R SOD1 animals. Furthermore, torsinA targeted mutant SOD1 for degradation via the proteasome, representing mechanistic insight on the activity that torsinA has on aggregate-prone proteins.

In turn, the AAA+ ATPase torsinA is thought to regulate force transmission from the cytoskeleton to the nucleus. In humans, mutations affecting nuclear envelope-associated proteins cause laminopathies, including progeria, myopathy, and dystonia, though the extent to which endogenous mechanical stresses contribute to these pathologies is unclear. Here, we use the <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> germline as a model to investigate mechanisms that maintain nuclear integrity as germ cell nuclei progress through meiotic development and migrate for gametogenesis-processes that require LINC complex function. We report that decreasing the function of the <i>C. elegans</i> torsinA homolog, OOC-5, rescues the sterility and premature aging caused by a null mutation in the single worm lamin homolog. We show that decreasing OOC-5/torsinA activity prevents nuclear collapse in lamin mutants by disrupting the function of the LINC complex. At a mechanistic level, OOC-5/torsinA promotes the assembly or maintenance of the lamin-associated LINC complex and this activity is also important for interphase nuclear pore complex insertion into growing germline nuclei.

Symptoms typically appear during childhood, suggesting the presence of an early critical period of sensorimotor circuit susceptibility to torsinA dysfunction. Here, we identified in two different DYT1 mouse strains, heterozygous torsinA knockout mice (Tor1a+/-) and human ΔGAG mutant torsinA transgenic mice (hMT), the anatomical abnormalities in the cerebellum, during a critical age for synaptogenesis (postnatal day 14, P14).

Finally, in support of the in vivo results, we also provide evidence of an impaired PF synaptogenesis in a co-culture system. Of note, these alterations were rescued and in part over-compensated in the adult age in both mouse strains, suggesting that torsinA dysfunction can induce an altered maturation of cerebellar synaptic contacts.

While 15 individuals with AMC5-TOR1A have been reported (less than 10 in detail), a systematic investigation of the full disease-associated spectrum has not been conducted. Here, we assess the clinical, radiological and molecular characteristics of 57 individuals from 40 families with biallelic variants in TOR1A. Median age at last follow-up was 3 years (0-24 years). Most individuals presented with severe congenital flexion contractures (95%) and variable developmental delay (79%). Motor symptoms were reported in 79% and included lower limb spasticity and pyramidal signs, as well as gait disturbances. Facial dysmorphism was an integral part of the phenotype, with key features being a broad/full nasal tip, narrowing of the forehead and full cheeks. Analysis of disease-associated manifestations delineated a phenotypic spectrum ranging from normal cognition and mild gait disturbance to congenital arthrogryposis, global developmental delay, intellectual disability, absent speech and inability to walk. In a subset, the presentation was consistent with foetal akinesia deformation sequence with severe intrauterine abnormalities. Survival was 71%, with higher mortality in males. Death occurred at a median age of 1.2 months (1 week-9 years), due to respiratory failure, cardiac arrest or sepsis.

The definite diagnosis was made on the basis of whole exome sequencing and multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification. The clinical features and gene test results were analyzed retrospectively. Results: Data of 9 patients (4 boys and 5 girls) diagnosed as myoclonus dystonia syndrome caused by SGCE variants were collected. The onset age ranged from 1 year to 3 years and 2 months. The first symptom was myoclonus in 4 cases, while dystonia in the remaining 5 cases. In the course of the disease, 9 cases had myoclonus and 8 had dystonia. Myoclonic jerks were characterized by involuntary jerks in both upper limbs in 8 patients. Six patients had involuntary jerks of lower limbs, resulting in gait instability or even falling. The myoclonus was exacerbated during the fine motor activities, emotional stress or fatigue. Dystonia was characterized by abnormal gait, including 5 cases with right leg dystonia, and 3 cases with the left leg dystonia. Three probands had a positive family history. Intellectual development was normal in all cases. There was no obvious abnormality in video-electroencephalogram (EEG) during both ictal and interictal periods. Electromyography (EMG) and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of 9 patients were normal.

In recent years, many new candidate genes are being identified as putative pathogenic factors in children with isolated dystonia due to the easy availability of whole-exome sequencing. Recently biallelic mutations in the COL6A3 gene were identified as a cause of rare dystonia (DYT)-27 syndrome. Till date, only six cases of DYT27 have been reported in the literature. METHODS:We report a new case of COL6A3 mutation associated early-onset isolated dystonia-DYT27. We did a review of the previously published cases of DYT27. Citations were identified through PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Google scholar searches using the search terms (including variations), \""Dystonia-27 or DYT27\"" or/and \""COL6A3 mutation associated early-onset isolated dystonia\"", combined with study filters for original research, case reports and case series. RESULTS:Next-generation sequencing in the index patient revealed two pathogenic compound heterozygous loss of function mutations in exon 10 and exon 12 of the COL6A3 gene coding for the alpha(α)3(VI) chain of type VI collagen. Together with the presented case, seven cases (five males) were available for analysis. The median age at onset was 22 years (range: 6-61). Dystonic symptoms were started from hands in five and from the neck in the remaining two patients. Five patients had favorable outcomes with trihexyphenidyl and botulinum toxin while tetrabenazine and levodopa were ineffective. CONCLUSIONS:Although it is a new entity that is only recently discovered, in future years many more new cases suffering from this particular entity are likely to be reported and the already heterogeneous clinical spectrum is likely to be further widespread in years to come.""","""2020""","[""col6a3 gene"", ""early-onset primary dystonia"", ""dyt27"", ""primary dystonia"", ""oromandibular dystonia""]"

It interacts physically with lamins, torsinA, emerin and protein phosphatase 1; potentially providing a pivotal mechanism for transducing signals across the inner nuclear membrane. In neurons a functional protein complex is formed, comprising LAP1 and torsinA and in skeletal muscle LAP1 and emerin likewise form a protein complex. Several isoforms of LAP1 have been reported across species. However, in humans only two isoforms have been described, LAP1B and LAP1C. The latter has only recently been reported, but its physiological function and mode of action are not clear. The first TOR1AIP1 (gene encoding LAP1) mutation identified is a single nucleotide deletion resulting in a frameshift and a putative truncated LAP1B protein (Turkish mutation). This has deleterious effects associated with a specific form of muscular dystrophy. A second point mutation, affecting both human LAP1 isoforms, was also recently described. This mutation involves the replacement of a single glutamic acid to alanine at position 482 (Moroccan Mutation), thereby causing severe dystonia, cerebellar atrophy and cardiomyopathy. This review focuses on the recently described human LAP1 isoform (LAP1C), the two recently reported LAP1 mutations and post-translational LAP1 modifications. The latter play an important role in regulating this protein.

Methods: The clinical data of 9 children with SGCE-related myoclonus dystonia syndrome admitted at either the Department of Neurology, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University or the Department of Pediatrics, Peking University First Hospital from May 2018 to October 2019 were collected and the patients were followed up. The definite diagnosis was made on the basis of whole exome sequencing and multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification. The clinical features and gene test results were analyzed retrospectively. Results: Data of 9 patients (4 boys and 5 girls) diagnosed as myoclonus dystonia syndrome caused by SGCE variants were collected. The onset age ranged from 1 year to 3 years and 2 months. The first symptom was myoclonus in 4 cases, while dystonia in the remaining 5 cases. In the course of the disease, 9 cases had myoclonus and 8 had dystonia. Myoclonic jerks were characterized by involuntary jerks in both upper limbs in 8 patients. Six patients had involuntary jerks of lower limbs, resulting in gait instability or even falling. The myoclonus was exacerbated during the fine motor activities, emotional stress or fatigue. Dystonia was characterized by abnormal gait, including 5 cases with right leg dystonia, and 3 cases with the left leg dystonia. Three probands had a positive family history. Intellectual development was normal in all cases. There was no obvious abnormality in video-electroencephalogram (EEG) during both ictal and interictal periods. Electromyography (EMG) and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of 9 patients were normal. Nine patients carried SGCE gene variants, including 3 frame shift variants, 2 nonsense variants, 2 missense variants, 1 fragment deletion variant and 1 splice site variant. Seven variants were inherited paternally, and 2 variants were de novo. Madopar was used in 8 patients, and nitrazepam in 4 patients, leading to the decrease in the myoclonus jerks and improvement of gait in 6 and 2 patients, respectively. Conclusions: SGCE gene variants can cause myoclonus dystonia syndrome. The onset of the disease may occur at infancy or preschool age, with either myoclonic jerks or dystonia as the initial symptom. Non-epileptic myoclonus is the prominent symptom, with upper limb mainly involved.

Twenty-two patients were positive for the GAG deletion in the DYT1 gene. Fifteen of them presented with the typical DYT1 phenotype (early, limb-onset generalized dystonia without spread to craniocervical muscles), four had limb-onset dystonia with spread to craniocervical muscles, two patients had arm-onset segmental dystonia and one had focal right-arm dystonia.

None carries the AJ haplotype; therefore, they probably represent different mutations in the DYT1 gene. The two French Canadian families, however, display the same haplotype. Estimates of penetrance in non-Jewish families range from .40 to .75. We identified disease gene carriers and, with adjustments for age at onset, obtained a direct estimate of penetrance of .46. This is consistent with estimates of 30%-40% in the AJ population. Two other non-Jewish families with atypical ITD (later onset and/or cranial or cervical involvement) are not linked to DYT1, which indicates involvement of other genes in dystonia.""","""1994""",[]

Since dystonic attacks occur in the absence of any lesion which can be defined by standard histopathological techniques in the central nervous system, the presumption is that dystonia in mutant hamsters is due to some biochemical disturbance activity in brain regions involved in motor functions. In the present study we determined the monoamine neurotransmitters dopamine, noradrenaline, adrenaline and serotonin (5-HT) as well as the dopamine metabolites homovanillic acid (HVA) and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and the 5-HT metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in 14 brain regions of male and female dystonic hamsters and age-matched non-dystonic controls. All determinations were done at age of maximum susceptibility for induction of dystonic attacks. Since both genders of dystonic hamsters exhibit the same characteristic age-dependent time-course of dystonia, it was assumed that only those biochemical alterations are critically involved in dystonia that occur in both female and male animals. The neurochemical data show that except for a significant decrease of dopamine and HVA in the olfactory bulb, no consistent changes in dopamine metabolism are present across brain regions, including the basal ganglia, of dystonic hamsters. In contrast, marked increases in noradrenaline and 5-HT or 5-HIAA were found in several brain areas of both genders, indicating an enhanced activity of central noradrenergic and serotonergic nuclei in the brainstem. The present results suggest the involvement of noradrenergic and serotonergic neural systems in the pathophysiology of dystonia. Based on these data and recent theoretical suggestions from clinical findings, drugs which reduce noradrenergic and serotonergic neurotransmission may be a useful therapeutic approach to dystonia.""","""1994""",[]

This type of dystonia following perinatal injury has been termed \""delayed onset dystonia due to static encephalopathy of childhood\"". According to the definition of dystonia, we were able to select 5 patients with the aetiologic diagnosis of perinatal asphyxia from the group of 347 out- and inpatients (1.4%) treated for various types of dystonia at the Movement Disorders Department (Institute of Neurology, CCS, Belgrade) from November 1986 to November 1994. At onset of dystonia the mean age of patients was 13.2 years (range from 10 to 17), with combined initial involvement of the arm and neck in 3 patients. The period from the onset of the disease to the maximum severity lasted 8.2 years (range from 4 to 14), resulting in segmental brachial dystonia in 3, hemidystonia and generalized dystonia in one patient each (Table 1). The adverse perinatal events are described in Table 2. Three of our patients had delayed achievements of developmental milestones. All patients were regularly schooled and had preserved intellectual capacities, except the patient 3 whose achievements were below average (IQ = 86). Different drugs were administered (Table 3), but moderate effects were achieved only with trihexyphenidyl in two patients (daily doses of 24 mg and 30 mg, respectively), and baclofen (80 mg p.d.) in one patient. In this study we describe 5 new patients who fulfilled the criteria for the diagnosis of delayed-onset dystonia due to perinatal asphyxia (Tables 1 and 2). We accepted the approach of Saint-Hilaire et al. to suggest a relationship between perinatal asphyxia and later occurrence of dystonia in our 5 patients. However, coincident occurrence of a primary dystonia with a static encephalopathy of childhood due to perinatal asphyxia cannot be excluded. This phenomenon of delayed appearance of dystonia was also described in other forms of static cerebral injury; i.e. stroke, head trauma or anoxic brain damage. Interestingly enough, age at the time of anoxia or brain insults seemed to be crucial for the development of dystonia: those who suffer acute brain insults during childhood or early life are more likely to develop dystonia than the older patients. Therefore, the \""static\"" nature of encephalopathy induced by perinatal asphyxia is questionable. Finally, this study strengthens the suggestion that perinatal asphyxia can lead to delayed-onset dystonia, and, since \""some of these patients closely resemble cases of idiopathic torsion dystonia, the prior occurrence of asphyxia should be used as a criterion of exclusion for that diagnosis\"".""","""1997""",[]

Furthermore drug induced dystonia but not levodopa induced dyskinesia occurs in childhood. The age dependent clinical features observed in these involuntary movements are thought to be due to the specific developmental processes of the pathway in the basal ganglia and its efferent projections, which are involved in the pathophysiology in the each disorder. For example, the dopamine activity is known to be increased in the striatum before ten years of age which decreases, rapidly during the first decade and further decreases in the next decade with the moderate degree till adult level.

Two neurologists reviewed the videotaped examination and rated the severity and constancy of dystonia, calculating a total dystonia score for each patient.<h4>Results</h4>Prevalence of dystonia of any severity was 95.2%. Twenty-four of 42 (57.1%) had dystonia in at least one body region that was moderate and present more than half of the time, and seven of 42 (16.7%) had dystonia that was severe and constant. The most prevalent types of dystonia were internal shoulder rotation (64.3%), sustained fist clenching (47.1%), excessive knee flexion (42.9%), and foot inversion (42.9%). In 37 of 42 (88.1%) patients, there were more than two types of dystonia, and in the average patient, three to four types of dystonia. The mean severity was between 1 (mild) and 2 (moderate), and the mean constancy was between 2 (present less than half of the time) and 3 (present more than half of the time). Multivariate linear regression revealed that disease duration (p = 0.0005) and taking an antidopaminergic agent (p = 0.03) were positively associated with the total dystonia score.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The majority of patients in this HD clinic exhibited some dystonia. The dystonia was present in several body regions and manifested by a variety of movements and postures not typical of idiopathic torsion dystonia. The dystonia was not bothersome to most patients, and its severity was a function of disease duration and use of an antidopaminergic agent.""","""1999""",[]

Stimuli were presented at different degrees of orientations and subjects had to mentally rotate them, in order to give a laterality judgement. Reaction times and accuracy were collected.<h4>Results</h4>DYT1 carriers, manifesting and non-manifesting dystonic symptoms, were slower in mentally rotating body parts (but not cars) than control subjects.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The DYT1 gene mutation is associated with a slowness in mental simulation of movements, independently from the presence of motor symptoms.<h4>Significance</h4>These findings suggest that the cognitive representation of body movements may be altered subclinically in dystonia, thus contributing to the endophenotypic trait of disease.""","""2008""",[]

The most severe early onset form of dystonia has been linked to mutations in the human DYT1 (TOR1A) gene encoding a protein termed torsinA. Moreover, dystonia and Parkinson disease share the common feature of reduced dopamine neurotransmission in the striatum, so we assumed that mutations in the DYT1 gene might have the same role in cases of early onset primary torsion dystonia (EOPTD) and early onset Parkinson disease (EOPD) that present dystonia. In this present study, 17 patients with EOPTD, 221 patients with EOPD and 164 control subjects were screened for mutations of the DYT1 gene by denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC), polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis and DNA sequencing. Our results showed that the GAG deletion was identified in 7 EOPTD patients, which results in Glu302del of DYT1 gene. No mutations were found in EOPD patients and control subjects.

Previous reports have suggested that torsin 1A, a protein mutated in this disease, might function as a chaperone that prevents the toxic aggregation of misfolded polypeptides. The aim of the study: The aim of this study was to verify the chaperone function of torsin 1A by investigating its ability to prevent the aggregation of huntingtin model peptides.<h4>Patients and methods</h4>Materials and methods: N-terminal mutant huntingtin fragments of different length were co-expressed in neuronal HT-22 and non-neuronal HeLa cells with either the wild-type or mutant (ΔE302/303) torsin 1A protein. The transfected cells were immunostained and analyzed for the presence of huntingtin aggregates using fluorescence microscopy.<h4>Results</h4>Results: The immunofluorescence analysis of huntingtin subcellular distribution within the transfected cells showed no significant difference between the huntingtin aggregation levels in cells co-expressing the wild-type torsin 1A and in control cells co-transfected with an empty vector. Instead, it was the increased level of huntingtin aggregation in the presence of the torsion dystonia-causing ΔE302/303 mutant that reached statistical significance in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Conclusions: Either torsin 1A does not function as a chaperone protein or huntingtin is not an efficient substrate for such a hypothetical chaperone activity. However, the ability of mutant torsin 1A to stimulate the accumulation of aggregation-prone polypeptides might constitute an important source of ΔE302/303 pathogenicity and thus a potential target for future therapy.""","""2018""","[""torsion dystonia"", ""huntingtin"", ""hela"", ""ht-22"", ""patients"", ""torsin 1a"", ""primary dystonia"", ""torsion dystonia type 1""]"

Due to advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies, the diagnosis of hereditary NMDs has dramatically improved in recent years.<h4>Methods and results</h4>In this study, we report an family with two siblings exhibiting two different NMD, Miyoshi muscular dystrophy (MMD) and early onset primary dystonia (EOPD). Whole exome sequencing (WES) identified a novel monoallelic frameshift deletion mutation (<i>dysferlin</i>: c.4404delC/p.I1469Sfs<sup>∗</sup>17) in the Dysferlin gene in the index patient who suffered from MMD. This deletion was inherited from his unaffected father and was carried by his younger sister with EOPD. However, immunostaining staining revealed an absence of dysferlin expression in the proband's muscle tissue and thus suggested the presence of the second underlying mutant allele in dysferlin. Using integrated RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) of muscle tissue, a novel deep intronic mutation in <i>dysferlin</i> (<i>dysferlin</i>: c.5341-415A > G) was discovered in the index patient.

"""20301665""","""DYT1 Early-Onset Isolated Dystonia""","""<h4>Clinical characteristics</h4>DYT1 early-onset isolated dystonia typically presents in childhood or adolescence and only on occasion in adulthood. Dystonic muscle contractions causing posturing or irregular tremor of a leg or arm are the most common presenting findings. Dystonia is usually first apparent with specific actions such as writing or walking. Over time, the contractions frequently (but not invariably) become evident with less specific actions and spread to other body regions. No other neurologic abnormalities are present. Disease severity varies considerably even within the same family. Isolated writer's cramp may be the only sign.<h4>Diagnosis/testing</h4>The diagnosis of DYT1 dystonia is established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous TOR1A pathogenic variant on molecular genetic testing. A TOR1A three base-pair deletion, c.907_909delGAG, is identified in most affected individuals.<h4>Management</h4>Treatment of manifestations: Oral medications, either alone or in combination, are usually tried first, including anticholinergics, baclofen, benzodiazepines, and others. Botulinum toxin injections for treatment of focal symptoms can be used in conjunction with oral medications. If oral medications and botulinum toxin injections do not provide sufficient control of symptoms, surgery enabling deep-brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus interna (GPi) should be considered. Prevention of secondary complications: Aggressive medical and surgical intervention to prevent contractures of the joints and deformities of the spine. Surveillance: Follow up with a neurologist specializing in movement disorders several times a year. Agents/circumstances to avoid: The extremities affected by dystonia should not be placed in a brace or cast, unless medically necessary, as this can worsen the dystonia.<h4>Genetic counseling</h4>DYT1 dystonia is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner with reduced penetrance. Offspring of an affected individual or of an asymptomatic individual known to have a TOR1A pathogenic variant have a 50% chance of inheriting the variant and if inherited a 30% chance of developing clinical findings. Once the TOR1A c.907_909delGAG deletion has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing for DYT1 dystonia are possible.""","""2016""",[]

EIF2AK2 sequencing in 191 unrelated patients with unexplained dystonia yielded 2 unrelated Caucasian patients with an identical heterozygous c.388G>A, p.Gly130Arg variant, occurring de novo in one case, another patient carrying a different heterozygous variant, c.413G>C, p.Gly138Ala, and one last patient, born from consanguineous parents, carrying a third, homozygous variant c.95A>C, p.Asn32Thr. These 3 missense variants are absent from gnomAD, and are located in functional domains of the encoded protein. In 3 patients, additional neurological manifestations were present, including intellectual disability and spasticity. EIF2AK2 encodes a kinase (protein kinase R [PKR]) that phosphorylates eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α), which orchestrates the cellular stress response.

"""8255463""","""Rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism.""","""We studied a large family with a previously undescribed, autosomal dominant dystonia-parkinsonism syndrome. We chose to call the disorder \""rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism\"" (RDP) based on the unusually rapid evolution of signs and symptoms. Affected individuals developed dystonia and parkinsonism between 14 and 45 years of age. The onset was acute in six individuals with the abrupt onset of symptoms over the course of several hours, and subacute in four others who had evolution over several days or weeks. Thereafter, progression of symptoms was usually very slow. Two had intermittent focal dystonia without parkinsonism, and one obligate gene carrier was asymptomatic at 68 years. CSF levels of homovanillic acid were decreased in the two individuals tested, but dopaminergic therapy provided only slight benefit. The DYT1 gene responsible for early-onset, generalized idiopathic torsion dystonia in Jewish and some non-Jewish families has been mapped to chromosome 9q34. Linkage analysis with three markers near the DYT1 gene showed several obligate recombinations, excluding DYT1 as a candidate gene for RDP. We believe RDP is unique and should be classified separately from other forms of hereditary dystonia-parkinsonism.""","""1993""",[]
"""8813214""","""Linkage studies in alcohol-responsive myoclonic dystonia.""","""A large German family with \""myoclonic dystonia with lightning jerks responsive to alcohol\"" was identified. Eleven affected pedigree members and six obligate gene carriers from five generations were identified. A description of one branch of this pedigree was published in 1964. Our examination 30 years after the initial report confirms the clinical syndrome of a nonprogressive movement disorder characterized by myoclonic jerks affecting the proximal muscles and the muscles of the trunk, accompanied by mild dystonic features in some affected family members. Segregation analysis favors autosomal dominant inheritance with high, but incomplete, penetrance in males and much lower penetrance in females. Linkage analysis was performed using simple sequence repeat polymorphisms (CA repeats) closely associated with or spanning the chromosomal regions containing 15 candidate genes: the gene for early-onset generalized torsion dystonia, DYT1 (chromosome 9q34); the genes for subunits alpha 2, beta 1, and gamma 1 (chromosome 4p12-4q13); for alpha 1, alpha 6, beta 2, and gamma 2 (chromosome 5q31.1-5q31.3); for alpha 4, alpha 5, beta 3, and gamma 3 (chromosome 15q11-15q13); for rho 1 and rho 2 (chromosome 6q14-6q21) of the gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptor; and for the alpha subunit of the glycine receptor (chromosome 5q31). By a combination of pairwise and multipoint linkage analysis, it could be excluded that any of these candidate gene-bearing chromosomal regions contain the disease gene in this family. We also excluded major portions of three chromosomal regions syntenic with mouse chromosome 3, which carries the murine beta subunit of the glycine receptor.""","""1996""",[]

We describe a German family with 5 clinically affected individuals carrying this mutation. In at least 4 of the 5 patients, the disease presented as a dystonic writer's cramp during late childhood or adolescence, which affected sequentially both sides but did not progress to a generalized form of dystonia.

These were evenly divided between male and female, but of the 226 patients, 225 were white and only one was black. Forty-two percent were Jewish, as contrasted with 3% Jewish population in the United States. It is interesting to note that a family history was obtained in 28% of both the Jewish and the non-Jewish groups. Thirty of the patients reported a significant viral infection within 3 months preceding the onset of symptoms. Only six patientss had a history of one or more remissions during the course of their illness. The mean duration of symptoms before examination in this series was 8.6 years with a duration of 1 to 42 years. Fifty-six of the patients had been diagnosed as having conversion hysteria at some time during the course of their illness. The majority of the patients had the onset of symptoms between the ages of 5 and 10, although the age span was from 2 to 45 years of age. Seventy-six of the patients had an IQ statistically significant above average (3). Each symptom, rate of progress of the disease, and various other factors in the history were corrolated with age, sex, ethnic group, mode of onset, and 20 other variables. The most pertinent subgroupings affecting the natural history were the age on onset and the ethnic group and family history. Trunkal involvement was most common in the non-Jewish group with a positive family history. This particular sub-group of patients showed predominately midline symptomatology. In the groups below the age of 13, the onset was almost invariably in one of the four limbs. However, in the group 14 years of age and older, 30% had their initial dystonic symptoms in the neck and a total of 40% of the patients whose onset was at age 14 or later, had marked nuchal symptoms. This clear-cut predominance of limb involvement in the youngest groups is also indicated by the observation that 38% in the youngest group had become confined to a wheelchair because of gait abnormalities, whereas none of those whose age of onset was 14 or older were disabled to this degree by gait abnormality. The most rapidly progressive and incapacitating symptomatology was seen in those patients with onset of symptoms below the age of 8 so that in general the younger the age at onset, the more rapid the progress of the symptoms.""","""1976""",[]
