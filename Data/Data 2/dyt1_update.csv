"""2317008""","""Dystonia gene in Ashkenazi Jewish population is located on chromosome 9q32-34.""","""Idiopathic torsion dystonia (ITD) is a neurological disorder characterized by sustained muscle contractions that appear as twisting movements of the limbs, trunk, and/or neck, which can progress to abnormal postures. Most familial forms of ITD follow autosomal dominant transmission with reduced penetrance. The frequency of ITD in the Ashkenazi Jewish population is five to ten times greater than that in other groups. Recently, a gene for ITD (DYT1) in a non-Jewish kindred was located on chromosome 9q32-34, with tight linkage to the gene encoding gelsolin (GSN). In the present study linkage analysis using DNA polymorphisms is used to locate a gene responsible for susceptibility to ITD in 12 Ashkenazi Jewish families. This dystonia gene exhibits close linkage with the gene encoding argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS), and appears by multipoint analysis to lie in the q32-34 region of chromosome 9, a region that also contains the loci for gelsolin and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase. The same gene may be responsible for ITD both in the non-Jewish kindred mentioned above and in the Ashkenazi Jewish families presented here. However, because there is substantial difference between the penetrance of the dominant allele in these two groups, two different mutations may be operating to produce susceptibility to this disease in the two groups.""","""1990""","[""dystonia"", ""ass"", ""argininosuccinate synthetase"", ""gelsolin"", ""gsn"", ""dyt1"", ""neurological disorder"", ""dopamine-beta-hydroxylase"", ""idiopathic torsion dystonia""]"

It has been suggested that inheritance may differ in Jews and non-Jews. In the present study, data gathered in a nationwide survey of ITD in Israel were analysed. Between 1969 and 1980, 47 patients were collected, of whom 40 were of European origin. In these European Jews, the ITD frequency was about 1:23 000 live births, which was five-fold greater than in Jews of Afro-Asian origin. Assuming that all cases fit the same genetic model, an X linked or a simple autosomal recessive model of inheritance did not agree well with our data. An autosomal dominant model with low penetrance could have accounted for our observations and would yield an ITD gene frequency in European Jews of 3 to 4:100 000. In view of the increased ages of their fathers, the isolated cases may have included some new mutations. Multifactorial inheritance was also possible.

Results are consistent with linkage to the DYT1 region. Affected individuals in these families are clinically similar to the AJ cases; i.e., the site of onset is predominantly in the limbs and at least one individual in each pedigree had onset before age 12 years. None carries the AJ haplotype; therefore, they probably represent different mutations in the DYT1 gene. The two French Canadian families, however, display the same haplotype. Estimates of penetrance in non-Jewish families range from .40 to .75. We identified disease gene carriers and, with adjustments for age at onset, obtained a direct estimate of penetrance of .46.

The remaining nine to 11 patients with generalized childhood dystonia are thought, because of a probable paternal age effect, to be examples of new dominant mutations.

Using (GT)n and RFLP markers in this region, we have identified obligate recombination events in some of these Jewish families, which further delineate the area containing the DYT1 gene to a 6-cM region bounded by loci AK1 and ASS. In 52 unrelated, affected Ashkenazi Jewish individuals, we have found highly significant linkage disequilibrium between a particular extended haplotype at the ABL-ASS loci and the DYT1 gene. The 4/A12 haplotype for ABL-ASS is present on 69% of the disease-bearing chromosomes among affected Jewish individuals and on only 1% of control Jewish chromosomes (chi 2 = 91.07, P much less than .001). The allelic association between this extended haplotype and DYT1 predicts that these three genes lie within 1-2 cM of each other; on the basis of obligate recombination events, the DYT1 gene is centromeric to ASS. Furthermore, this allelic association supports the idea that a single mutation event is responsible for most hereditary cases of dystonia in the Jewish population. Of the 53 definitely affected typed, 13 appear to be sporadic, with no family history of dystonia. However, the proportion of sporadic cases which potentially carry the A12 haplotype at ASS (8/13 [62%]) is similar to the proportion of familial cases with A12 (28/40 [70%]). This suggests that many sporadic cases are hereditary, that the disease gene frequency is greater than 1/15,000, and that the penetrance is lower than 30%, as previously estimated in this population. Most affected individuals were heterozygous for the ABL-ASS haplotype, a finding supporting autosomal dominant inheritance of the DYT1 gene. The ABL-ASS extended-haplotype status will provide predictive value for carrier status in Jewish individuals.

We studied a genetically homogeneous group of 41 subjects with the 460InsA mutation in FTL1, documenting the presentation, clinical course, biochemistry and neuroimaging.

The majority reported a family history of a movement disorder often misdiagnosed as Huntington's disease. The disease progressed relentlessly, becoming generalized over a 5-10 year period, eventually leading to aphonia, dysphagia and severe motor disability with subcortical/frontal cognitive dysfunction as a late feature. A characteristic action-specific facial dystonia was common (65%), and in 63% there was asymmetry throughout the disease course. Serum ferritin levels were low in the majority of males and post-menopausal females, but within normal limits for pre-menopausal females. MR brain imaging was abnormal on all affected individuals and one presymptomatic carrier. In conclusion, isolated parkinsonism is unusual in neuroferritinopathy, and unlike Huntington's disease, cognitive changes are absent or subtle in the early stages.

These involuntary movements when occur in the childhood show the specific ages of onset and the courses. For example postural dystonia occurs in childhood but action dystonia tend to occur in later ages. Postural tremor occurs after the second decades but resting tremor does not occur in childhood. Furthermore drug induced dystonia but not levodopa induced dyskinesia occurs in childhood. The age dependent clinical features observed in these involuntary movements are thought to be due to the specific developmental processes of the pathway in the basal ganglia and its efferent projections, which are involved in the pathophysiology in the each disorder. For example, the dopamine activity is known to be increased in the striatum before ten years of age which decreases, rapidly during the first decade and further decreases in the next decade with the moderate degree till adult level. The direct pathway, which is predominant in the ventral area in the basal ganglia, matures earlier than the indirect pathway, which is predominant in the dorsal area. In this paper the pathophysiologies of the hereditary progressive dystonia with marked diurnal fluctuation, juvenile parkinsonism, idiopathic torsion dystonia, chorea, ballismus and tics, all of which occur in the childhood, are discussed from the view point of the age dependent specificities of the involved pathways in the basal ganglia and their projections during development.""","""1997""","[""juvenile parkinsonism"", ""tremor"", ""idiopathic torsion dystonia"", ""dyskinesia"", ""involuntary movements"", ""athetosis"", ""ballismus"", ""involuntary movement disorders"", ""levodopa"", ""chorea"", ""dopamine"", ""dystonia""]"

Linkage analysis was performed to DYT1, DYT6, DYT7, DYT11, DYT13, DYT15, and ATP7B with microsatellite markers and the THAP1 (DYT6), PRKRA (DYT16), and ATP7B (WND) genes were sequenced. Reevaluation of the family identified 9 living affected family members, 6 of whom are newly affected.

Two newly described features included an extrusional tongue dystonia and a unique \""hobby horse gait.\"" Genetic analyses excluded all tested loci. Haplotype analysis of the ATP7B region resulted in three different combinations of the two parental alleles in the 8 investigated siblings of the 2 deceased WND patients, indicating that the fourth combination (of two mutated alleles) had occurred only in the deceased WND patients.

"""19345148""","""Mutations in THAP1 (DYT6) and generalised dystonia with prominent spasmodic dysphonia: a genetic screening study.""","""<h4>Background</h4>DYT6 is a primary, early-onset torsion dystonia; however, unlike in DYT1 dystonia, the symptoms of DYT6 dystonia frequently involve the craniocervical region. Recently, two mutations in THAP1, the gene that encodes THAP (thanatos-associated protein) domain-containing apoptosis-associated protein 1 (THAP1), have been identified as a cause of DYT6 dystonia.<h4>Methods</h4>We screened THAP1 by sequence analysis and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 160 white patients of European ancestry who had dystonia with an early age at onset (n=64), generalised dystonia (n=35), a positive family history of dystonia (n=56), or facial or laryngeal dystonia. Another 160 patients with dystonia were screened for reported and novel variants in THAP1. 280 neurologically healthy controls were screened for the newly identified and previously reported changes in THAP1 and these and an additional 75 controls were screened for a rare non-coding mutation.<h4>Findings</h4>We identified two mutations in THAP1 (388_389delTC and 474delA), respectively, in two (1%) German patients from the 160 patients with dystonia. Both mutation carriers had laryngeal dystonia that started in childhood and both went on to develop generalised dystonia. Thus, two of three patients with early-onset generalised dystonia with orobulbar involvement had mutations in THAP1. One of the identified patients with DYT6 dystonia had two family members with subtle motor signs who also carried the same mutation. A rare substitution in the 5'untranslated region (-236_235GA-->TT) was found in 20 of 320 patients and in seven of 355 controls (p=0.0054).<h4>Interpretation</h4>Although mutations in THAP1 might have only a minor role in patients with different, but mainly focal, forms of dystonia, they do seem to be associated with early-onset generalised dystonia with spasmodic dysphonia. This combination of symptoms might be a characteristic feature of DYT6 dystonia and could be useful in the differential diagnosis of DYT1, DYT4, DYT12, and DYT17 dystonia. In addition to the identified mutations, a rare non-coding substitution in THAP1 might increase the risk of dystonia.<h4>Funding</h4>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; Volkswagen Foundation; Dystonia Medical Research Foundation; University of Lübeck.""","""2009""","[""thap (thanatos-associated protein) domain-containing apoptosis-associated protein 1"", ""c.474dela"", ""474dela"", ""human"", ""patients"", ""patient"", ""infant"", ""mammalian"", ""infants"", ""boy"", ""child"", ""woman"", ""humans"", ""children"", ""girl"", ""mammal"", ""boys"", ""participants"", ""women"", ""man"", ""donor"", ""persons"", ""men"", ""person"", ""people"", ""girls"", ""peoples"", ""participant"", ""outpatient"", ""donor variant"", ""patient variant"", ""mammalians"", ""homo sapiens"", ""pt"", ""homo sapiens linnaeus, 1758"", ""pts"", ""h. sapiens"", ""humans. subsp"", ""human pv"", ""hs"", ""mans"", ""patients. variant"", ""patients. str"", ""pats"", ""patients' variant"", ""mammalia"", ""children. pv"", ""p=ns"", ""human variant"", ""pns"", ""ch"", ""hsa"", ""patients, bv"", ""op"", ""child."", ""patients, pv"", ""patients."", ""patients,"", ""patients. pv"", ""para"", ""patients; str"", ""p = ns"", ""p =ns"", ""pten"", ""human bv"", ""ppl"", ""patients (variant"", ""humans, variant"", ""hu"", ""patients (pv"", ""patients pv"", ""humans, bv"", ""human biovar"", ""ptts"", ""pat"", ""patients (bv"", ""women. bv"", ""women. pv"", ""donor pv"", ""patient, variant"", ""human subspecies"", ""d+/r"", ""patients). pv"", ""patients; variant"", ""patient pv"", ""p"", ""patients), str"", ""pn"", ""thap1"", ""dyt12"", ""torsion dystonia"", ""dyt4"", ""spasmodic dysphonia"", ""dyt6"", ""dystonia"", ""laryngeal dystonia"", ""388_389deltc"", ""dyt1"", ""dyt17""]"

To assess more broadly the role of this gene, we screened for mutations in families that included one family member who had early-onset, non-focal primary dystonia.<h4>Methods</h4>We identified 36 non-DYT1 multiplex families in which at least one person had non-focal involvement at an age of onset that was younger than 22 years. All three coding exons of THAP1 were sequenced, and the clinical features of individuals with mutations were compared with those of individuals who were negative for mutations in THAP1. Genotype-phenotype differences were also assessed.<h4>Findings</h4>Of 36 families, nine (25%) had members with mutations in THAP1, and most were of German, Irish, or Italian ancestry. One family had the Amish-Mennonite founder mutation, whereas the other eight families each had novel, potentially truncating or missense mutations. The clinical features of the families with mutations conformed to the previously described DYT6 phenotype; however, age at onset was extended from 38 years to 49 years. Compared with non-carriers, mutation carriers were younger at onset and their dystonia was more likely to begin in brachial, rather than cervical, muscles, become generalised, and include speech involvement. Genotype-phenotype differences were not found.<h4>Interpretation</h4>Mutations in THAP1 underlie a substantial proportion of early-onset primary dystonia in non-DYT1 families. The clinical features that are characteristic of affected individuals who have mutations in THAP1 include limb and cranial muscle involvement, and speech is often affected.<h4>Funding</h4>Dystonia Medical Research Foundation; Bachmann-Strauss Dystonia and Parkinson Foundation; National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke; Aaron Aronov Family Foundation.""","""2009""","[""primary dystonia"", ""stroke"", ""neurological disorders"", ""dyt1"", ""thap1"", ""dyt6"", ""bachmann-strauss dystonia and parkinson"", ""dystonia"", ""cranial muscle involvement""]"

Two were small deletions, 2 were nonsense, and 5 were missense. Eight mutations were heterozygous, and 1 was homozygous. The main clinical presentation of cases with THAP1 mutations was early-onset (<30 years) dystonia in the craniocervical region or the limbs (8 of 9 patients). There was phenotypic variability with laryngeal or oromandibular dystonia present in 3 cases. Four of 9 THAP1 cases developed generalized dystonia.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The number of THAP1 mutations has been significantly expanded, indicating an uncommon but important cause of dystonia. Coding mutations account for 9 of 362 dystonia cases, indicating a mutation frequency of 2.5% of dystonia cases in the population that we have screened. The majority of cases reported here with THAP1 mutations had craniocervical- or limb-onset segmental dystonia, but we also identified 1 homozygous THAP1 mutation, associated initially with writer's dystonia and then developing segmental dystonia. Three of our patients had a nonsense or frameshift THAP1 mutation and the clinical features of laryngeal or oromandibular dystonia.

This disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant mode with reduced penetrance (30%-40%). The abnormal involuntary movements associated with this disease are believed to be caused by unbalanced neural transmission in the basal ganglia. Previous linkage disequilibrium studies in the AJ population placed the DYT1 gene in a 2-cM region between the loci D9S62a and ASS.

Previous haplotype analysis in a 2 cM region surrounding the DYT1 gene showed that a single founder mutation (DYT1AJ) was responsible for most cases of early onset PTD in the North American AJ population and refined the most likely location of the gene to a 150 kb interval between the marker loci D9S2161 and D9S63. Recently, the majority of cases of early onset PTD in both AJ and non-Jewish patients were found to carry a unique 3-bp (GAG) deletion in the coding region of the DYT1 gene. This deletion appears to have arisen more than once, suggesting independent mutational events. In this study, we analysed the haplotypes surrounding DYT1 in 9 AJ and 15 non-Jewish British patients carrying the GAG deletion in the DYT1 gene. We found that all AJ British patients carried the same haplotype as the North American Jews, sustaining the theory that the current British AJ community descends from the same small group of individuals as the North American Jewry. Furthermore, in the non-Jewish British patients, only a limited number of distinct founder mutations was observed.

Voxel-based analysis confirmed these findings and additionally revealed reduced RAC binding in the ventrolateral thalamus of both groups of mutation carriers. As in the striatum, the thalamic binding reductions were more pronounced in DYT6 carriers and were not influenced by the presence of clinical manifestations.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Reduced D(2) receptor availability in carriers of dystonia genes is compatible with dysfunction or loss of D(2)-bearing neurons, increased synaptic dopamine levels, or both. These changes, which may be present to different degrees in the DYT1 and DYT6 genotypes, are likely to represent susceptibility factors for the development of clinical manifestations in mutation carriers.""","""2009""","[""rac"", ""dopamine"", ""[(11)c] raclopride"", ""d(2)"", ""dystonia"", ""dysfunction"", ""dyt6"", ""dyt1""]"

Because of the established role of the TOR1A gene in heritable generalised dystonia (DYT1), a potential genetic contribution of TOR1A to the more prevalent and diverse presentations of late onset, focal dystonia has been suggested.<h4>Results</h4>A novel TOR1A missense mutation (c.613T-->A, p.F205I) in a patient with late onset, focal dystonia is reported. The mutation occurs in a highly evolutionarily conserved region encoding the AAA-ATPase domain. Expression assays revealed that expression of F205I or Delta E, but not wildtype TOR1A, produced frequent intracellular inclusions.<h4>Conclusions</h4>A novel, rare TOR1A variant has been identified in an individual with late onset, focal dystonia and evidence provided that the mutation impairs TOR1A function.

However, the technical approach, complications, and results of DBS in children have not been well documented.<h4>Methods</h4>A database of DBS implantations performed at a single institution, prospectively established in 1998, was reviewed for patients who received DBS prior to the age of 18. Diagnoses, surgical technique, and complications were noted. Outcomes were assessed using standard rating scales of neurological function.<h4>Results</h4>Of 815 patients undergoing DBS implantation over a 12-year period, 31 were children (mean age at surgery 13.2 years old, range 4-17 years old). Diagnoses included the following: DYT1 primary dystonia (autosomal dominant, Tor1AΔGAG mutation, 10 cases), non-DYT1 primary dystonia (3 cases), secondary dystonia (11 cases), neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA, 3 cases), levodopa-responsive parkinsonism (2 cases), Lesch-Nyhan disease (1 case), and glutaric aciduria Type 1 (1 case). Six children ages 15-17 years old underwent awake microelectrode-guided surgery. For 25 children operated under general anesthesia, the surgical technique evolved from microelectrode-guided surgery to image-guided surgeries using real-time intraoperative MR imaging or CT for lead location confirmation. Complications included 5 hardware infections, all in children younger than 10 years old. At 1 year after implantation, patients with DYT1 dystonia had a mean improvement in the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale movement subscore of 75%, while those with secondary dystonia had only small improvements. Outcomes in the 3 children with NBIA were disappointing.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Results of DBS in children with primary and secondary dystonias were similar to those in adults, with excellent results for DYT1 dystonia in children without fixed orthopedic deformity and much more modest results in secondary dystonia.

The authors evaluated clinical outcomes and targeting accuracy in patients with dystonia who underwent lead placement using an iMRI targeting platform.<h4>Methods</h4>Patients with dystonia undergoing iMRI-guided lead placement in the globus pallidus pars internus (GPi) were identified. Patients with a prior ablative or MER-guided procedure were excluded from clinical outcomes analysis. Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale (BFMDRS) scores and Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS) scores were assessed preoperatively and at 6 and 12 months postoperatively. Other measures analyzed include lead accuracy, complications/adverse events, and stimulation parameters.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 60 leads were implanted in 30 patients. Stereotactic lead accuracy in the axial plane was 0.93 ± 0.12 mm from the intended target. Nineteen patients (idiopathic focal, n = 7; idiopathic segmental, n = 5; DYT1, n = 1; tardive, n = 2; other secondary, n = 4) were included in clinical outcomes analysis.

In the cerebellar vermis, VAChT expression was also significantly decreased in patients versus controls, but independently of age.

DYT1 dystonia patients show trends of decreased striatal ligand-binding activities to dopamine receptors 1 (D1R) and 2 (D2R). Dyt1 ΔGAG knock-in (KI) mice, which have the corresponding ΔGAG deletion, similarly exhibit reduced striatal D1R and D2R-binding activities and their expression levels. While the consequences of D2R reduction have been well characterized, relatively little is known about the effect of D1R reduction. Here, locomotor responses to D1R and D2R antagonists were examined in Dyt1 KI mice. Dyt1 KI mice showed significantly less responsiveness to both D1R antagonist SCH 23390 and D2R antagonist raclopride. The electrophysiological recording indicated that Dyt1 KI mice showed a significantly increased paired-pulse ratio of the striatal D1R-expressing medium spiny neurons and altered miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents. To analyze the in vivo torsinA function in the D1R-expressing neurons further, Dyt1 conditional knockout (Dyt1 d1KO) mice in these neurons were generated. Dyt1 d1KO mice had decreased spontaneous locomotor activity and reduced numbers of slips in the beam-walking test. Dyt1 d1KO male mice showed abnormal gait. Dyt1 d1KO mice showed defective striatal D1R maturation. Moreover, the mutant striatal D1R-expressing medium spiny neurons had increased capacitance, decreased sEPSC frequency, and reduced intrinsic excitability.

In this study we sought to determine whether torsinA dysfunction in cholinergic neurons alone is sufficient to generate the sensorimotor dysfunction and brain changes associated with dystonia, or if torsinA dysfunction in a broader subset of cell types is needed. We generated two genetically modified mouse models, one with selective Dyt1 knock-out from dopamine-2 receptor expressing neurons (D2KO) and one where only cholinergic neurons are impacted (Ch2KO). We assessed motor deficits and performed in vivo 11.1 T functional MRI to assess sensory-evoked brain activation and connectivity, along with diffusion MRI to assess brain microstructure. We found that D2KO mice showed greater impairment than Ch2KO mice, including reduced sensory-evoked brain activity in key regions of the sensorimotor network, and altered functional connectivity of the striatum that correlated with motor deficits.

This autosomal dominant disease has variable penetration. It has long been recognized that some individuals in families with typical disease only have segmentary, multifocal or even focal dystonia. It has been proven by molecular genetics that the disease can be expressed simply by familial writers cramp with particularly early, and often bilateral, onset. The mutation concerns the torsine A gene, whose function remains to be elucidated. Torsine A is found in the central nervous system, particularly in the dopaminergic neurons of the locus niger. GENERALIZED PRIMARY DYSTONIA UNRELATED TO DYT-1: These dystonias are phenotypically different: younger and more variable age at onset, focal localization early in the disease course generally involving the cervical or cephalic pole, less severe course. Certain forms are linked to chromosome 8 (locus DYT 6). PRIMARY FOCAL OR SEGMENTARY DYSTONIAS: These primary dystonias cause functional or postural disorders and were long considered as sporadic despite rare familial cases suggesting a genetic factor. When searched for systematically, familial cases are found in 20 to 30% of the cases. The dystonia is transmitted by dominant autosomal heredity with reduced penetration. Phenotypically, expression is heterogeneous with a constant frequency of unrecognized or neglected forms and of postural forms. One form is known to be linked to chromosome 18 (locus DYT 7). DOPA-RESPONSIVE DYSTONIA: This class represents 5 to 10% of childhood dystonias. The phenotypic expression is polymorphous but symptoms always improve with very small doses of L-dopa. Both sporadic, and more frequently familial, cases are described. Some forms are recessive, caused by mutation of the gene coding for tyrosine hydroxylase, others are autosomal dominant, often linked to mutation of the gene coding for GTP cyclohydrolase.

Awareness of the diverse etiologic categories of childhood-onset dystonia is necessary to accurate diagnosis approach. Clinical examination and cerebral magnetic resonance imaging are the keys of this diagnosis approach. Primary dystonia is defined as syndromes in which dystonia is the sole phenotypic manifestation (especially no cognitive deterioration is observed, and brain MRI is normal); DYT1 dystonia, in which the abnormal gene is located on chromosome 9, is the most frequent childhood-onset primary dystonia; progressive generalisation of the abnormal movements occur in 70p.cent of the patients.

Clinical presentation of DRD might be atypical (mimicking cerebral palsy or isolated limb pain without diurnal fluctuation). DRD is rare, but a trial of L-dopa should be performed on all patients with childhood-onset dystonia, lasting at least one month. Secondary dystonias or heredodegenerative diseases are the most frequent etiology of childhood-onset dystonic syndromes. Among a huge range of heredodegenerative disease, those that are amenable to a specific treatment, such as Wilson's disease or creatine deficiency, should be particularly investigated. The main objective of investigation of dystonia is to identify secondary dystonias or heredodegenerative diseases. Further investigations will be performed according to the clinical characteristics of the dystonia, to the presence of associated neurological or extraneurological symptoms, and according to brain imaging; this approach must be discussed for each single patient.

Due to the advent of next-generation sequencing, the field of dystonia genetics has been evolving very rapidly over the past two years, resulting in the reporting of 'DYT1-25' and, for the first time, in the identification of genes associated with adult-onset focal/segmental dystonia. However, three of these putative new genes still await independent confirmation (TUBB4/DYT4; CIZ1/DYT23; ANO3/DYT24) and only 11 'DYT' genes have been unequivocally demonstrated to cause different forms of dystonia. Based on a recent consensus approach, dystonias are subdivided on clinical grounds into isolated (with or without tremor) and combined (with other movement disorders) forms. Confirmed genes for isolated dystonias include TOR1A/DYT1; THAP1/DYT6; GNAL/DYT25. In the combined forms, dystonia is accompanied by parkinsonism (GCH1/DYT5a; TH/DYT5b; ATP1A3/DYT12; TAF1/DYT3) or myoclonus (SGCE/DYT11). Persistent and paroxysmal forms are distinguished according to their temporal pattern.

In families with action-type dystonia, there are cases with focal and segmental dystonia. Ages of onset of postural-type dystonia are around 6 years, and 8 to 10 years in cases of action-type dystonia. Focal and segmental dystonia develops in the teens. Mental and psychological functions are preserved. DYT5 is caused by heterozygous mutations of the GCH1 gene, located on 14q22.1-q22.2. Again, mental and psychological functions are preserved. Clinically, there are two types: postural and action. Postural-type dystonia occurs around 6 years of age, with postural dystonia of one leg, and all extremities and trunk muscles are involved by the late teens.

In contrast to the frequent sporadic forms, a variety of rare familial forms are caused by genetic mutations with mendelian inheritance.

Currently, 18 gene loci have been described causing primary dystonia, dystonia-plus syndromes or paroxysmal dystonia. The most frequent form of inherited dystonia, according to current knowledge, is early-onset generalized DYT1 dystonia, caused by a deletion of three basepairs, GAG, in the DYT1 (TOR1A) gene. It is thought that the protein encoded by this gene, torsinA, participates in association of the endoplasmatic reticulum and the nuclear envelope with the cytoskeleton and hereby might influence the reaction of cells to various stresses and/or the development of specific neuronal populations involved in movement control in the brain.

The effect of the missense variants was assessed using prediction tools and luciferase reporter gene assays. This indicated the Ile80Val substitution as a benign variant. The subcellular localization of Asp191Thrfs*9 suggests a disturbed nuclear import for this mutation. Thus, we consider six of the 10 novel variants as pathogenic mutations accounting for a mutation frequency of 1.1%. Mutation carriers presented mainly with early onset dystonia (<12 years in five of six patients).

Dystonia has traditionally been considered a disorder of the basal ganglia. However, growing evidence suggests that the cerebellum may be involved in certain types of dystonia, raising several questions. Can different types of dystonia be classified as either a basal ganglia disorder or a cerebellar disorder? Is dystonia a network disorder that involves the cerebellum and basal ganglia? If dystonia is a network disorder, how can we target treatments to alleviate symptoms in patients? A recent study by Chen et al, using the pharmacological mouse model of rapid-onset dystonia parkinsonism, has provided some insight into these important questions. They showed that the cerebellum can directly modulate basal ganglia activity through a short latency cerebello-thalamo-basal ganglia pathway. Further, this article and others have provided evidence that in some cases, aberrant cerebello-basal ganglia communication can be involved in dystonia. In this review we examine the evidence for the involvement of the cerebellum and cerebello-basal ganglia interactions in dystonia. We conclude that there is ample evidence to suggest that the cerebellum plays a role in some dystonias, including the early-onset primary torsion dystonia DYT1 and that further studies examining the role of this brain region and its interaction with the basal ganglia in dystonia are warranted. © 2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.""","""2017""","[""primary torsion dystonia"", ""human"", ""patients"", ""patient"", ""infant"", ""mammalian"", ""infants"", ""boy"", ""child"", ""woman"", ""humans"", ""children"", ""girl"", ""mammal"", ""boys"", ""participants"", ""women"", ""man"", ""donor"", ""persons"", ""men"", ""person"", ""people"", ""girls"", ""peoples"", ""participant"", ""outpatient"", ""donor variant"", ""patient variant"", ""mammalians"", ""homo sapiens"", ""pt"", ""homo sapiens linnaeus, 1758"", ""pts"", ""h. sapiens"", ""humans. subsp"", ""human pv"", ""hs"", ""mans"", ""patients. variant"", ""patients. str"", ""pats"", ""patients' variant"", ""mammalia"", ""children. pv"", ""p=ns"", ""human variant"", ""pns"", ""ch"", ""hsa"", ""patients, bv"", ""op"", ""child."", ""patients, pv"", ""patients."", ""patients,"", ""patients. pv"", ""para"", ""patients; str"", ""p = ns"", ""p =ns"", ""pten"", ""human bv"", ""ppl"", ""patients (variant"", ""humans, variant"", ""hu"", ""patients (pv"", ""patients pv"", ""humans, bv"", ""human biovar"", ""ptts"", ""pat"", ""patients (bv"", ""women. bv"", ""women. pv"", ""donor pv"", ""patient, variant"", ""human subspecies"", ""d+/r"", ""patients). pv"", ""patients; variant"", ""patient pv"", ""p"", ""patients), str"", ""pn"", ""mice"", ""mouse"", ""murine"", ""transgenic mice"", ""nude mice"", ""transgenic"", ""mice (pv"", ""mus musculus"", ""house mouse"", ""m. musculus"", ""129/sv"", ""mmu"", ""t/+ mice"", ""mice,"", ""129sv"", ""n/+ mice"", ""mouse variant"", ""mice."", ""mouse:"", ""129 sv"", ""tgm"", ""house mouse subspecies"", ""tg mice"", ""mouse strain"", ""tg"", ""mice. pv"", ""mice. bv"", ""h-/- mouse"", ""mouse substrain"", ""transgenic) mice"", ""t. mice"", ""tr"", ""m:c"", ""mo"", ""h/+ mouse"", ""mice (strain"", ""mu"", ""nude\"" mice"", ""murine str"", ""mouses"", ""nude             mice"", ""tg-mice"", ""transgenic-mice"", ""nm"", ""n (+/+) mice"", ""n(-/-)) mice"", ""n(-/-) mice"", ""mouse biovar"", ""n  mice"", ""mouse subspecies"", ""h mouse"", ""mice. variant"", ""tm"", ""mus musculus,"", ""transgenic, mice"", ""nude-mice"", ""m. m"", ""dyt1"", ""basal ganglia disorder"", ""movement disorder"", ""dystonia parkinsonism"", ""parkinson and movement disorder society"", ""dystonias"", ""cerebellar disorder"", ""dystonia""]"

Targeting the intrinsic capacities of neuroprotective proteins to restore neuronal function and/or attenuate degeneration represents a potential means toward therapeutic intervention. The product of the human DYT1 gene, torsinA, is a member of the functionally diverse AAA+ family of proteins and exhibits robust molecular-chaperone-like activity, both in vitro and in vivo. Although mutations in DYT1 are associated with a rare form of heritable generalized dystonia, the native function of torsinA seems to be cytoprotective in maintaining the cellular threshold to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Here we explore the potential for torsinA to serve as a buffer to attenuate the cellular consequences of misfolded-protein stress as it pertains to the neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The selective vulnerability of motor neurons to degeneration in ALS mouse models harboring mutations in superoxide dismutase (SOD1) has been found to correlate with regional-specific ER stress in brains. Using Caenorhabditis elegans as a system to model ER stress, we generated transgenic nematodes overexpressing either wild-type or mutant human SOD1 to evaluate their relative impact on ER stress induction in vivo. These studies revealed a mutant-SOD1-specific increase in ER stress that was further exacerbated by changes in temperature, all of which was robustly attenuated by co-expression of torsinA. Moreover, through complementary behavioral analysis, torsinA was able to restore normal neuronal function in mutant G85R SOD1 animals. Furthermore, torsinA targeted mutant SOD1 for degradation via the proteasome, representing mechanistic insight on the activity that torsinA has on aggregate-prone proteins. These results expand our understanding of proteostatic mechanisms influencing neuronal dysfunction in ALS, while simultaneously highlighting the potential for torsinA as a novel target for therapeutic development.""","""2013""","[""neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis"", ""caenorhabditis elegans"", ""c. elegans"", ""caenorhabditiselegans"", ""roundworm"", ""c.elegans"", ""c elegans"", ""ce"", ""c-elegans"", ""caenorhabditis"", ""mice"", ""mouse"", ""murine"", ""transgenic mice"", ""nude mice"", ""transgenic"", ""mice (pv"", ""mus musculus"", ""house mouse"", ""m. musculus"", ""129/sv"", ""mmu"", ""t/+ mice"", ""mice,"", ""129sv"", ""n/+ mice"", ""mouse variant"", ""mice."", ""mouse:"", ""129 sv"", ""tgm"", ""house mouse subspecies"", ""tg mice"", ""mouse strain"", ""tg"", ""mice. pv"", ""mice. bv"", ""h-/- mouse"", ""mouse substrain"", ""transgenic) mice"", ""t. mice"", ""tr"", ""m:c"", ""mo"", ""h/+ mouse"", ""mice (strain"", ""mu"", ""nude\"" mice"", ""murine str"", ""mouses"", ""nude             mice"", ""tg-mice"", ""transgenic-mice"", ""nm"", ""n (+/+) mice"", ""n(-/-)) mice"", ""n(-/-) mice"", ""mouse biovar"", ""n  mice"", ""mouse subspecies"", ""h mouse"", ""mice. variant"", ""tm"", ""mus musculus,"", ""transgenic, mice"", ""nude-mice"", ""m. m"", ""sod1"", ""dystonia"", ""human"", ""patients"", ""patient"", ""infant"", ""mammalian"", ""infants"", ""boy"", ""child"", ""woman"", ""humans"", ""children"", ""girl"", ""mammal"", ""boys"", ""participants"", ""women"", ""man"", ""donor"", ""persons"", ""men"", ""person"", ""people"", ""girls"", ""peoples"", ""participant"", ""outpatient"", ""donor variant"", ""patient variant"", ""mammalians"", ""homo sapiens"", ""pt"", ""homo sapiens linnaeus, 1758"", ""pts"", ""h. sapiens"", ""humans. subsp"", ""human pv"", ""hs"", ""mans"", ""patients. variant"", ""patients. str"", ""pats"", ""patients' variant"", ""mammalia"", ""children. pv"", ""p=ns"", ""human variant"", ""pns"", ""ch"", ""hsa"", ""patients, bv"", ""op"", ""child."", ""patients, pv"", ""patients."", ""patients,"", ""patients. pv"", ""para"", ""patients; str"", ""p = ns"", ""p =ns"", ""pten"", ""human bv"", ""ppl"", ""patients (variant"", ""humans, variant"", ""hu"", ""patients (pv"", ""patients pv"", ""humans, bv"", ""human biovar"", ""ptts"", ""pat"", ""patients (bv"", ""women. bv"", ""women. pv"", ""donor pv"", ""patient, variant"", ""human subspecies"", ""d+/r"", ""patients). pv"", ""patients; variant"", ""patient pv"", ""p"", ""patients), str"", ""pn"", ""torsina"", ""als"", ""g85r"", ""g86r"", ""gly 85 --> arg"", ""neurodegenerative diseases"", ""locomotive defects"", ""dyt1"", ""neuronal dysfunction""]"

"""11528394""","""Mutations in the gene encoding epsilon-sarcoglycan cause myoclonus-dystonia syndrome.""","""The dystonias are a common clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of movement disorders. More than ten loci for inherited forms of dystonia have been mapped, but only three mutated genes have been identified so far. These are DYT1, encoding torsin A and mutant in the early-onset generalized form, GCH1 (formerly known as DYT5), encoding GTP-cyclohydrolase I and mutant in dominant dopa-responsive dystonia, and TH, encoding tyrosine hydroxylase and mutant in the recessive form of the disease. Myoclonus-dystonia syndrome (MDS; DYT11) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by bilateral, alcohol-sensitive myoclonic jerks involving mainly the arms and axial muscles. Dystonia, usually torticollis and/or writer's cramp, occurs in most but not all affected patients and may occasionally be the only symptom of the disease. In addition, patients often show prominent psychiatric abnormalities, including panic attacks and obsessive-compulsive behavior. In most MDS families, the disease is linked to a locus on chromosome 7q21 (refs. 11-13). Using a positional cloning approach, we have identified five different heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the gene for epsilon-sarcoglycan (SGCE), which we mapped to a refined critical region of about 3.2 Mb. SGCE is expressed in all brain regions examined. Pedigree analysis shows a marked difference in penetrance depending on the parental origin of the disease allele.

"""12151848""","""Dystonia: clinical features, genetics, and treatment.""","""<h4>Purpose of review</h4>The present review covers recent advances in dystonia research related to dystonia genetics and treatment. These have led to the discovery of novel dystonia genes and loci, to changing classification schemes, and to the introduction of improved and new treatment options.<h4>Recent findings</h4>Currently 13 different forms of dystonia can be distinguished on a genetic basis (dystonia types 1-13). Recently, a novel gene locus (DYT13) was detected in a family with segmental dystonia, and the gene causing myoclonus-dystonia was identified (SGCE). Furthermore, a novel mutation in the DYT1 gene is associated with a myoclonus-dystonia phenotype. Regarding dystonia treatment, patients refractory to botulinum toxin type A can now be treated with botulinum toxin type B. Selective peripheral denervation remains an effective form of treatment for patients with secondary, but probably not with primary botulinum toxin treatment failure. Finally, a renaissance of functional surgical ablative procedures has taken place, with high frequency deep brain stimulation being introduced in dystonia treatment. Bilateral pallidotomy or pallidal stimulation may provide major benefit especially in patients with generalized, disabling dystonia with the most dramatic improvements in dystonia type 1 patients. Neurostimulation may also be effective in primary segmental axial dystonia, myoclonus-dystonia, and tardive dystonia.<h4>Summary</h4>The recent mapping of additional dystonia gene loci, the identification of novel dystonia genes, and the characterization of proteins encoded by these genes have enhanced our understanding of various forms and aspects of the dystonias and have opened up new avenues for research. Treatment options include both medical and surgical therapies, with deep brain simulation being the most recent development.""","""2002""","[""human"", ""patients"", ""patient"", ""infant"", ""mammalian"", ""infants"", ""boy"", ""child"", ""woman"", ""humans"", ""children"", ""girl"", ""mammal"", ""boys"", ""participants"", ""women"", ""man"", ""donor"", ""persons"", ""men"", ""person"", ""people"", ""girls"", ""peoples"", ""participant"", ""outpatient"", ""donor variant"", ""patient variant"", ""mammalians"", ""homo sapiens"", ""pt"", ""homo sapiens linnaeus, 1758"", ""pts"", ""h. sapiens"", ""humans. subsp"", ""human pv"", ""hs"", ""mans"", ""patients. variant"", ""patients. str"", ""pats"", ""patients' variant"", ""mammalia"", ""children. pv"", ""p=ns"", ""human variant"", ""pns"", ""ch"", ""hsa"", ""patients, bv"", ""op"", ""child."", ""patients, pv"", ""patients."", ""patients,"", ""patients. pv"", ""para"", ""patients; str"", ""p = ns"", ""p =ns"", ""pten"", ""human bv"", ""ppl"", ""patients (variant"", ""humans, variant"", ""hu"", ""patients (pv"", ""patients pv"", ""humans, bv"", ""human biovar"", ""ptts"", ""pat"", ""patients (bv"", ""women. bv"", ""women. pv"", ""donor pv"", ""patient, variant"", ""human subspecies"", ""d+/r"", ""patients). pv"", ""patients; variant"", ""patient pv"", ""p"", ""patients), str"", ""pn"", ""segmental dystonia"", ""sgce"", ""dystonia"", ""dyt1"", ""tardive dystonia"", ""dyt13"", ""dystonias"", ""myoclonus-dystonia"", ""segmental axial dystonia"", ""dystonia type""]"

The HIV protease inhibitor, ritonavir, was among 18 compounds found to normalize hTorsinA mislocalization. Using a DYT1 knock-in mouse model to test efficacy on brain pathologies, we found that ritonavir restored multiple brain abnormalities across development. Ritonavir acutely corrected striatal cholinergic interneuron physiology in the mature brain and yielded sustained correction of diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging signals when delivered during a discrete early developmental window.

Recent knockout studies indicate that D2R on cholinergic interneurons (Chls) has a significant role in corticostriatal plasticity, while D2R on medium spiny neurons (MSNs) plays a minor role. To determine how reduced D2Rs on ChIs and MSNs affect motor performance, we generated ChI- or MSN-specific D2R conditional knockout mice (Drd2 ChKO or Drd2 sKO). The striatal ChIs in the Drd2 ChKO mice showed an increased firing frequency and impaired quinpirole-induced inhibition, suggesting a reduced D2R function on the ChIs.

Predictive factors for the degree of improvement after GPi DBS include shorter disease duration and dystonia subtype with idiopathic isolated dystonia usually responding better than acquired combined dystonias. Other factors contributing to variability in outcome may include body distribution, pattern of dystonia and DBS related factors such as lead placement and stimulation parameters. The responsiveness to DBS appears to vary between different monogenic forms of dystonia, with some improving more than others.

As there is no effective treatment of this disease, preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) may be a useful option for at-risk couples to establish an DYT1 mutation-free pregnancy. PGD was performed for two obligate carriers of the DYT1 3-bp deletion, using blastomere testing to preselect the mutation-free embryos, based on mutation analysis with simultaneous testing of the three closely linked markers, D9S62, D9S63 and ASS. Of 19 tested blastomeres in three cycles, 17 had conclusive information about the mutation and linked markers, of which eight were predicted to be free of 3-bp deletion. Six of these embryos were transferred back to patients, two in each cycle, yielding singleton DYT1 3-bp deletion-free clinical pregnancies in two. One of these pregnancies was terminated due to severe anencephaly and the other resulted in birth of a mutation-free child.

The results are briefly compared with those reported for DBS in DYT1 dystonia (Oppenheim dystonia), which is caused by the DYT1 gene. METHODS: Enrollment in this prospective expanded pilot study was limited to adult patients with severely disabling, medically refractory non-DYT1 generalized dystonia or choreoathetosis. Six consecutive patients underwent follow-up examinations at defined intervals of 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years postsurgery. There were five women and one man, and their mean age at surgery was 45.5 years. Formal assessments included both the Burke-Fahn-Marsden dystonia scale and the recently developed Unified Dystonia Rating Scale. Two patients had primary generalized non-DYT1 dystonia, and four suffered from choreoathetosis secondary to infantile cerebral palsy. Bilateral quadripolar DBS electrodes were implanted in all instances, except in one patient with markedly asymmetrical symptoms. There were no adverse events related to surgery. The Burke-Fahn-Marsden scores in the two patients with generalized dystonia improved by 78 and 71% at 3 months, by 82 and 69% at 1 year, and by 78 and 70% at 2 years postoperatively. This was paralleled by marked amelioration of disability scores. The mean improvement in Burke-Fahn-Marsden scores in patients with choreoathetosis was 12% at 3 months, 29% at 1 year, and 23% at 2 years postoperatively, which was not significant. Two of these patients thought that they had achieved marked improvement at 2 years postoperatively, although results of objective evaluations were less impressive. In these two patients there was a minor but stable improvement in disability scores. All patients had an improvement in pain scores at the 2-year follow-up review. Medication was tapered off in both patients with generalized dystonia and reduced in two of the patients with choreoathetosis. All stimulation-induced side effects were reversible on adjustment of the DBS settings. Energy consumption of the batteries was considerably higher than in patients with Parkinson disease. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic pallidal DBS is a safe and effective procedure in generalized non-DYT1 dystonia, and it may become the procedure of choice in patients with medically refractory dystonia.

The purpose of this study was to establish whether the sensory system is affected in other types of dystonias and whether the contralateral hand is also involved in FHD. We used a spatial acuity measure (Johnson-Van Boven-Phillips domes) to evaluate sensory spatial discrimination in both hands of patients with different forms of dystonias including primary generalized DYT1 dystonia (associated with a unique deletion in the DYT1 gene) (n = 13), FHD (n = 15), benign essential blepharospasm (n = 9), cervical dystonia (n = 10) and in age-matched controls. Clinical evaluation included the Fahn dystonia scale for the focal dystonia groups and the Marsden-Burke-Fahn scale for the generalized dystonia group. Spatial discrimination was normal in patients with DYT1 dystonia, despite all of these patients having hand dystonia. However, spatial discrimination thresholds were significantly increased in both hands in the focal dystonia groups (thresholds were similar for each group) and did not correlate significantly with either severity or duration of dystonic symptoms. Thresholds were significantly increased in the dominant hand compared with the non-dominant hand only within the FHD group. Our observations demonstrate involvement of both the dominant and non-dominant somatosensory cortices, and suggest that abnormal sensory processing is a fundamental disturbance in patients with focal dystonia. These findings of altered sensory processing in idiopathic focal but not generalized DYT1 dystonia suggest both a primary pathophysiological role for the phenomenon in focal dystonia and divergent pathophysiological processes in the two conditions.""","""2003""","[""human"", ""patients"", ""patient"", ""infant"", ""mammalian"", ""infants"", ""boy"", ""child"", ""woman"", ""humans"", ""children"", ""girl"", ""mammal"", ""boys"", ""participants"", ""women"", ""man"", ""donor"", ""persons"", ""men"", ""person"", ""people"", ""girls"", ""peoples"", ""participant"", ""outpatient"", ""donor variant"", ""patient variant"", ""mammalians"", ""homo sapiens"", ""pt"", ""homo sapiens linnaeus, 1758"", ""pts"", ""h. sapiens"", ""humans. subsp"", ""human pv"", ""hs"", ""mans"", ""patients. variant"", ""patients. str"", ""pats"", ""patients' variant"", ""mammalia"", ""children. pv"", ""p=ns"", ""human variant"", ""pns"", ""ch"", ""hsa"", ""patients, bv"", ""op"", ""child."", ""patients, pv"", ""patients."", ""patients,"", ""patients. pv"", ""para"", ""patients; str"", ""p = ns"", ""p =ns"", ""pten"", ""human bv"", ""ppl"", ""patients (variant"", ""humans, variant"", ""hu"", ""patients (pv"", ""patients pv"", ""humans, bv"", ""human biovar"", ""ptts"", ""pat"", ""patients (bv"", ""women. bv"", ""women. pv"", ""donor pv"", ""patient, variant"", ""human subspecies"", ""d+/r"", ""patients). pv"", ""patients; variant"", ""patient pv"", ""p"", ""patients), str"", ""pn"", ""hand dystonia"", ""dystonias"", ""focal dystonia"", ""dystonia"", ""fhd"", ""benign essential blepharospasm"", ""dystonic symptoms"", ""cervical dystonia"", ""dyt1"", ""focal hand dystonia""]"
"""33468570""","""Disease Modeling with Human Neurons Reveals LMNB1 Dysregulation Underlying DYT1 Dystonia.""","""DYT1 dystonia is a hereditary neurologic movement disorder characterized by uncontrollable muscle contractions. It is caused by a heterozygous mutation in <i>Torsin A</i> (<i>TOR1A</i>), a gene encoding a membrane-embedded ATPase. While animal models provide insights into disease mechanisms, significant species-dependent differences exist since animals with the identical heterozygous mutation fail to show pathology. Here, we model DYT1 by using human patient-specific cholinergic motor neurons (MNs) that are generated through either direct conversion of patients' skin fibroblasts or differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). These human MNs with the heterozygous <i>TOR1A</i> mutation show reduced neurite length and branches, markedly thickened nuclear lamina, disrupted nuclear morphology, and impaired nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT) of mRNAs and proteins, whereas they lack the perinuclear \""blebs\"" that are often observed in animal models. Furthermore, we uncover that the nuclear lamina protein LMNB1 is upregulated in DYT1 cells and exhibits abnormal subcellular distribution in a cholinergic MNs-specific manner. Such dysregulation of LMNB1 can be recapitulated by either ectopic expression of the mutant <i>TOR1A</i> gene or shRNA-mediated downregulation of endogenous <i>TOR1A</i> in healthy control MNs. Interestingly, downregulation of LMNB1 can largely ameliorate all the cellular defects in DYT1 MNs. These results reveal the value of disease modeling with human patient-specific neurons and indicate that dysregulation of LMNB1, a crucial component of the nuclear lamina, may constitute a major molecular mechanism underlying DYT1 pathology.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Inaccessibility to patient neurons greatly impedes our understanding of the pathologic mechanisms for dystonia. In this study, we employ reprogrammed human patient-specific motor neurons (MNs) to model DYT1, the most severe hereditary form of dystonia. Our results reveal disease-dependent deficits in nuclear morphology and nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT). Most importantly, we further identify LMNB1 dysregulation as a major contributor to these deficits, uncovering a new pathologic mechanism for DYT1 dystonia.""","""2021""","[""tor1a"", ""dystonia"", ""human"", ""patients"", ""patient"", ""infant"", ""mammalian"", ""infants"", ""boy"", ""child"", ""woman"", ""humans"", ""children"", ""girl"", ""mammal"", ""boys"", ""participants"", ""women"", ""man"", ""donor"", ""persons"", ""men"", ""person"", ""people"", ""girls"", ""peoples"", ""participant"", ""outpatient"", ""donor variant"", ""patient variant"", ""mammalians"", ""homo sapiens"", ""pt"", ""homo sapiens linnaeus, 1758"", ""pts"", ""h. sapiens"", ""humans. subsp"", ""human pv"", ""hs"", ""mans"", ""patients. variant"", ""patients. str"", ""pats"", ""patients' variant"", ""mammalia"", ""children. pv"", ""p=ns"", ""human variant"", ""pns"", ""ch"", ""hsa"", ""patients, bv"", ""op"", ""child."", ""patients, pv"", ""patients."", ""patients,"", ""patients. pv"", ""para"", ""patients; str"", ""p = ns"", ""p =ns"", ""pten"", ""human bv"", ""ppl"", ""patients (variant"", ""humans, variant"", ""hu"", ""patients (pv"", ""patients pv"", ""humans, bv"", ""human biovar"", ""ptts"", ""pat"", ""patients (bv"", ""women. bv"", ""women. pv"", ""donor pv"", ""patient, variant"", ""human subspecies"", ""d+/r"", ""patients). pv"", ""patients; variant"", ""patient pv"", ""p"", ""patients), str"", ""pn"", ""neurological movement disorder"", ""torsin a"", ""dyt1"", ""lmnb1""]"

The coding substitutions were: c. 238A>G (p.Ile80Val), found in two patients, and c.167A>G (p.Glu56Gly), found in one patient. The same variations were present also in the patients' symptomatic as well as asymptomatic relatives. Mutation penetration in the analyzed families was 50-66.7%.

Results.  The mean BFM percentage change (improvement in postoperative score from baseline) was 51.8% (range -34% to 100%). Significantly better outcomes were achieved with stimulation of the globus pallidus internus (GPi) than with stimulation of the posterior portion of the ventral lateral (VLp) nucleus of the thalamus (p = 0.0001). The etiology of the dystonia also had a significant effect on outcomes. Statistically significant improvements in outcomes were seen for all etiologic categories, except encephalitis. Dystonia due to birth injury and encephalitis had significantly worse outcomes when compared to other etiologies. However, there were no significant differences in the outcomes of patients who were DYT1 (DYT1 is the gene associated with the disorder Dystonia Musculorum Deformans) gene positive, DYT1 gene negative, or had pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN), tardive dyskinesia, and idiopathic and posttraumatic dystonias. Longer duration of dystonia symptoms correlated negatively with surgical outcome. A regression model using the three variables-stimulation site, etiology of dystonia, and duration of dystonia symptoms-explained 51% of the variance in outcomes. Conclusion.  Deep brain stimulation of the GPi provides significant improvement in BFM scores in a variety of dystonic conditions.""","""2006""","[""gpi"", ""gpi-"", ""encephalitis"", ""human"", ""patients"", ""patient"", ""infant"", ""mammalian"", ""infants"", ""boy"", ""child"", ""woman"", ""humans"", ""children"", ""girl"", ""mammal"", ""boys"", ""participants"", ""women"", ""man"", ""donor"", ""persons"", ""men"", ""person"", ""people"", ""girls"", ""peoples"", ""participant"", ""outpatient"", ""donor variant"", ""patient variant"", ""mammalians"", ""homo sapiens"", ""pt"", ""homo sapiens linnaeus, 1758"", ""pts"", ""h. sapiens"", ""humans. subsp"", ""human pv"", ""hs"", ""mans"", ""patients. variant"", ""patients. str"", ""pats"", ""patients' variant"", ""mammalia"", ""children. pv"", ""p=ns"", ""human variant"", ""pns"", ""ch"", ""hsa"", ""patients, bv"", ""op"", ""child."", ""patients, pv"", ""patients."", ""patients,"", ""patients. pv"", ""para"", ""patients; str"", ""p = ns"", ""p =ns"", ""pten"", ""human bv"", ""ppl"", ""patients (variant"", ""humans, variant"", ""hu"", ""patients (pv"", ""patients pv"", ""humans, bv"", ""human biovar"", ""ptts"", ""pat"", ""patients (bv"", ""women. bv"", ""women. pv"", ""donor pv"", ""patient, variant"", ""human subspecies"", ""d+/r"", ""patients). pv"", ""patients; variant"", ""patient pv"", ""p"", ""patients), str"", ""pn"", ""tardive dyskinesia"", ""dystonia"", ""birth injury"", ""dystonic conditions"", ""posttraumatic dystonias"", ""pkan"", ""disorder dystonia"", ""pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration"", ""dyt1""]"

"""12652041""","""Deep brain stimulation for dystonia in adults. Overview and developments.""","""The renaissance of functional neurosurgery in the treatment of Parkinson's disease has sparked also the interest in other movement disorders which are refractory to medical treatment. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been used only since a few years in dystonia patients. This review summarizes the available data on pallidal and thalamic DBS for various dystonic syndromes. The major advantage of DBS as compared to radiofrequency lesioning is that it allows performing contemporaneous bilateral surgery with relatively low morbidity in these patients. The posteroventral lateral globus pallidus internus (GPi) has been the preferred target in most instances, thus far. While phasic dystonic movements may improve early after surgery, the response of tonic dystonic movements to chronic stimulation may be delayed. The most beneficial results have been achieved in patients with primary genetic generalized and segmental dystonia, myoclonic dystonia, and complex cervical dystonia. Outcome has been varied in patients with other dystonic disorders, in particular those with secondary dystonia. Most studies have reported on relatively short follow-up periods, on single cases, or were retrospective. Pallidal DBS has been shown to be effective in complex cervical dystonia yielding both symptomatic and functional benefit for up to 2.5 years of follow-up. Dramatic improvement has been obtained in children and in adults with DYT1 positive dystonia. Also, patients with non DYT1 genetic dystonia achieved sustained benefit for up to 2 years of follow-up. Preliminary experience indicates that choreoathetosis in patients with cerebral palsy responds less well to pallidal DBS, and that it may not be effective at all in some patients. In single instances unilateral pallidal DBS has been shown to yield valuable benefit in patients with hemidystonia. The experience with DBS for treatment of Meige syndrome and other focal dystonias has been explored only recently. There is much less experience with thalamic DBS for dystonia. Thalamic DBS has been shown to be effective in single cases with posttraumatic dystonia, postanoxic dystonia and paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dystonia. Future perspectives of DBS for treatment of dystonia include the development of new technology, the evaluation of the possible role of other targets, and carefully planned studies to further establish the role of surgery.""","""2002""","[""myoclonic dystonia"", ""movement disorders"", ""human"", ""patients"", ""patient"", ""infant"", ""mammalian"", ""infants"", ""boy"", ""child"", ""woman"", ""humans"", ""children"", ""girl"", ""mammal"", ""boys"", ""participants"", ""women"", ""man"", ""donor"", ""persons"", ""men"", ""person"", ""people"", ""girls"", ""peoples"", ""participant"", ""outpatient"", ""donor variant"", ""patient variant"", ""mammalians"", ""homo sapiens"", ""pt"", ""homo sapiens linnaeus, 1758"", ""pts"", ""h. sapiens"", ""humans. subsp"", ""human pv"", ""hs"", ""mans"", ""patients. variant"", ""patients. str"", ""pats"", ""patients' variant"", ""mammalia"", ""children. pv"", ""p=ns"", ""human variant"", ""pns"", ""ch"", ""hsa"", ""patients, bv"", ""op"", ""child."", ""patients, pv"", ""patients."", ""patients,"", ""patients. pv"", ""para"", ""patients; str"", ""p = ns"", ""p =ns"", ""pten"", ""human bv"", ""ppl"", ""patients (variant"", ""humans, variant"", ""hu"", ""patients (pv"", ""patients pv"", ""humans, bv"", ""human biovar"", ""ptts"", ""pat"", ""patients (bv"", ""women. bv"", ""women. pv"", ""donor pv"", ""patient, variant"", ""human subspecies"", ""d+/r"", ""patients). pv"", ""patients; variant"", ""patient pv"", ""p"", ""patients), str"", ""pn"", ""paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dystonia"", ""choreoathetosis"", ""dystonic syndromes"", ""tonic dystonic"", ""dystonic disorders"", ""dystonia"", ""meige syndrome"", ""parkinson's disease"", ""dystonias"", ""dystonic movements"", ""dyt1"", ""cerebral palsy"", ""hemidystonia"", ""posttraumatic dystonia""]"
"""9837831""","""Search for a founder mutation in idiopathic focal dystonia from Northern Germany.""","""Both the discovery of the DYT1 gene on chromosome 9q34 in autosomal dominant early-onset torsion dystonia and the detection of linkage for one form of adult-onset focal dystonia to chromosome 18p (DYT7) in a family from northern Germany provide the opportunity to further investigate genetic factors in the focal dystonias. Additionally, reports of linkage disequilibrium between several chromosome 18 markers and focal dystonia, both in sporadic patients from northern Germany and in members of affected families from central Europe suggest the existence of a founder mutation underlying focal dystonia in this population. To evaluate the role of these loci in focal dystonia, we tested 85 patients from northern Germany who had primary focal dystonia, both for the GAG deletion in the DYT1 gene on chromosome 9q34 and for linkage disequilibrium at the chromosome 18p markers D18S1105, D18S1098, D18S481, and D18S54. None of these patients had the GAG deletion in the DYT1 gene. Furthermore, Hardy-Weinberg analysis of markers on 18p in our patient population and in 85 control subjects from the same region did not support linkage disequilibrium. Taken together, these results suggest that most cases of focal dystonia in patients of northern German or central European origin are due neither to the GAG deletion in DYT1 nor to a proposed founder mutation on chromosome 18p but must be caused by other genetic or environmental factors.""","""1998""","[""human"", ""patients"", ""patient"", ""infant"", ""mammalian"", ""infants"", ""boy"", ""child"", ""woman"", ""humans"", ""children"", ""girl"", ""mammal"", ""boys"", ""participants"", ""women"", ""man"", ""donor"", ""persons"", ""men"", ""person"", ""people"", ""girls"", ""peoples"", ""participant"", ""outpatient"", ""donor variant"", ""patient variant"", ""mammalians"", ""homo sapiens"", ""pt"", ""homo sapiens linnaeus, 1758"", ""pts"", ""h. sapiens"", ""humans. subsp"", ""human pv"", ""hs"", ""mans"", ""patients. variant"", ""patients. str"", ""pats"", ""patients' variant"", ""mammalia"", ""children. pv"", ""p=ns"", ""human variant"", ""pns"", ""ch"", ""hsa"", ""patients, bv"", ""op"", ""child."", ""patients, pv"", ""patients."", ""patients,"", ""patients. pv"", ""para"", ""patients; str"", ""p = ns"", ""p =ns"", ""pten"", ""human bv"", ""ppl"", ""patients (variant"", ""humans, variant"", ""hu"", ""patients (pv"", ""patients pv"", ""humans, bv"", ""human biovar"", ""ptts"", ""pat"", ""patients (bv"", ""women. bv"", ""women. pv"", ""donor pv"", ""patient, variant"", ""human subspecies"", ""d+/r"", ""patients). pv"", ""patients; variant"", ""patient pv"", ""p"", ""patients), str"", ""pn"", ""dystonia"", ""dyt7"", ""dyt1"", ""gag"", ""gag+"", ""torsion dystonia"", ""focal dystonia"", ""focal dystonias""]"
"""20301587""","""SGCE Myoclonus-Dystonia""","""<h4>Clinical characteristics</h4>SGCE myoclonus-dystonia (SGCE-M-D) is a movement disorder characterized by a combination of rapid, brief muscle contractions (myoclonus) and/or sustained twisting and repetitive movements that result in abnormal postures (dystonia). The myoclonic jerks typical of SGCE-M-D most often affect the neck, trunk, and upper limbs with less common involvement of the legs. Approximately 50% of affected individuals have additional focal or segmental dystonia, presenting as cervical dystonia and/or writer's cramp. Non-motor features may include alcohol abuse, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and anxiety disorders. Symptom onset is usually in the first decade of life and almost always by age 20 years, but ranges from age six months to 80 years. Most affected adults report a dramatic reduction in myoclonus in response to alcohol ingestion. SGCE-M-D is compatible with an active life of normal span.<h4>Diagnosis/testing</h4>The diagnosis of SGCE-M-D is established in a proband with characteristic clinical features by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in SGCE.<h4>Management</h4>Treatment of manifestations: Class 1 evidence supports the improvement of myoclonus and dystonia with zonisamide. Benzodiazepines (particularly clonazepam) and antiepileptics used to treat myoclonus (especially valproate and levitiracetam) also improve myoclonus in individuals with myoclonus-dystonia. The response to other antiepileptics (e.g., topiramate) is more variable. Anticholinergic medication may improve dystonia. Botulinum toxin injection may be especially helpful for cervical dystonia. Improvement with L-5-hydroxytryptophan, L-dopa, and the salt of sodium oxybate has been reported. Deep brain stimulation has improved both myoclonus and dystonia, with most targeting the globus pallidus interna (GPi); however, success with ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus (VIM) target has also been reported. Other: Symptoms of SGCE-M-D often improve short term with ingestion of alcohol, but the risk of addiction recommends against its long-term use.<h4>Genetic counseling</h4>SGCE-M-D is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner with penetrance determined by the parental origin of the altered SGCE allele: an SGCE pathogenic variant on the paternally derived (expressed) SGCE allele generally results in disease; a pathogenic variant on the maternally derived (silenced) SGCE allele typically does not result in disease. Most individuals with SGCE-M-D inherited the disorder from a heterozygous parent who may or may not have clinical signs of M-D (as phenotypic expression in the parent would depend on the gender of the transmitting grandparent). Each child of an individual with SGCE-M-D has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Almost all children who inherit an SGCE pathogenic variant from their father develop symptoms, whereas only ~5% of children who inherit an SGCE pathogenic variant from their mother develop symptoms. Once the SGCE pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing and preimplantation genetic diagnosis are possible.""","""2020""","[""vim"", ""obsessive-compulsive disorder"", ""benzodiazepines"", ""clonazepam"", ""tremor"", ""human"", ""patients"", ""patient"", ""infant"", ""mammalian"", ""infants"", ""boy"", ""child"", ""woman"", ""humans"", ""children"", ""girl"", ""mammal"", ""boys"", ""participants"", ""women"", ""man"", ""donor"", ""persons"", ""men"", ""person"", ""people"", ""girls"", ""peoples"", ""participant"", ""outpatient"", ""donor variant"", ""patient variant"", ""mammalians"", ""homo sapiens"", ""pt"", ""homo sapiens linnaeus, 1758"", ""pts"", ""h. sapiens"", ""humans. subsp"", ""human pv"", ""hs"", ""mans"", ""patients. variant"", ""patients. str"", ""pats"", ""patients' variant"", ""mammalia"", ""children. pv"", ""p=ns"", ""human variant"", ""pns"", ""ch"", ""hsa"", ""patients, bv"", ""op"", ""child."", ""patients, pv"", ""patients."", ""patients,"", ""patients. pv"", ""para"", ""patients; str"", ""p = ns"", ""p =ns"", ""pten"", ""human bv"", ""ppl"", ""patients (variant"", ""humans, variant"", ""hu"", ""patients (pv"", ""patients pv"", ""humans, bv"", ""human biovar"", ""ptts"", ""pat"", ""patients (bv"", ""women. bv"", ""women. pv"", ""donor pv"", ""patient, variant"", ""human subspecies"", ""d+/r"", ""patients). pv"", ""patients; variant"", ""patient pv"", ""p"", ""patients), str"", ""pn"", ""dyt1"", ""myoclonic jerks"", ""panic attacks"", ""hemiparesis"", ""alcohol abuse"", ""movement disorder"", ""dystonia"", ""anxiety"", ""depression"", ""l-5-hydroxytryptophan"", ""myoclonus"", ""inherited the disorder"", ""personality disorders"", ""dysarthria"", ""sodium oxybate"", ""ocd"", ""topiramate"", ""cervical dystonia"", ""valproate"", ""l-dopa"", ""neurologic deficits"", ""sgce"", ""myoclonus-dystonia"", ""alcohol"", ""drd2""]"

Electrodes were implanted bilaterally in the globus pallidus internus (GPi) using the Neuromate robot without the stereotactic frame. The authors calculated the distances between the electrodes and their respective planned trajectories, merging the postoperative CT with the preoperative plan using VoXim software. Clinical outcome was monitored using validated scales for dystonia and myoclonus preoperatively and at 1 month and 6 months postoperatively and by means of a quality-of-life questionnaire for children, administered before surgery and at 6 months' follow-up. We also recorded complications derived from the implantation technique, \""hardware,\"" and stimulation.<h4>Results</h4>Six patients aged 7 to 16 years and diagnosed with isolated dystonia ( DYT1 negative) (3 patients), choreo-dystonia related to PDE2A mutation (1 patient), or myoclonus-dystonia syndrome SGCE mutations (2 patients) were evaluated during a period of 6 to 19 months. The average accuracy in the placement of the electrodes was 1.24 mm at the target point. At the 6-month follow-up, patients showed an improvement in the motor (65%) and functional (48%) components of the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale. Patients with myoclonus and SGCE mutations also showed an improvement in action myoclonus (95%-100%) and in functional tests (50%-75%) according to the Unified Motor-Rating Scale. The Neuro-QOL score revealed inconsistent results, with improvement in motor function and social relationships but worsening in anxiety, cognitive function, and pain.

Genetic testing for DYT1 and DYT11 was performed through polymerase chain reaction amplification and direct sequencing of the specific exons of genes. For the first patient, initial bilateral ventral intermediate thalamus nucleus (Vim) DBS was performed. Because of worsening dystonia after initial improvement in symptoms, subsequent bilateral globus pallidus internus (GPi) DBS was offered at 43 months after initial surgery, which reversed the deterioration and restored the motor function. For the second patient, initial improvement in motor symptoms and quality of life was sustained at the follow-up 6 months after bilateral Vim DBS treatment.

For such patients, therapeutic brain stimulation is becoming increasingly used.<h4>Objectives</h4>To review the evidence and effect sizes for treating different types of dystonia with different types of brain stimulation and to discuss recent advances relevant to patient selection, surgical approach, programming, and mechanism of action.<h4>Evidence review</h4>PubMed was searched for publications on the clinical effect of brain stimulation in dystonia up through December 31, 2014. Recent meta-analyses, consensus statements, and evidence-based guidelines were incorporated. Emphasis was placed on deep brain stimulation (DBS) and randomized clinical trials; however, other stimulation modalities and trial designs were included. For each intervention the mean change in dystonia severity, number of patients studied, and evidence of efficacy based on American Academy of Neurology criteria were determined.<h4>Findings</h4>Strong (level B) evidence supports the use of DBS for the treatment of primary generalized or segmental dystonia, especially when due to mutation in the DYT1 gene, as well as for patients with cervical dystonia. Large effect sizes have also been reported for DBS treatment of tardive dystonia, writer's cramp, cranial dystonia, myoclonus dystonia, and off-state dystonia associated with Parkinson disease. Lesser benefit is generally seen in dystonia secondary to structural brain damage. Other brain stimulation techniques, including epidural cortical stimulation and noninvasive brain stimulation, have been investigated, but generally report smaller effect sizes in fewer patients.<h4>Conclusions and relevance</h4>Patients with dystonia that is not adequately controlled with standard medical therapy should be referred for consideration of DBS, especially patients with generalized, segmental, or cervical dystonia.

Broadening of phenotype of some of the previously described hereditary dystonias and environmental risk factors and trends in treatment will be covered.<h4>Recent findings</h4>Based on phenomenology, a new consensus update on the definition, phenomenology and classification of dystonia and a syndromic approach to guide diagnosis have been proposed. Terminology has changed and 'isolated dystonia' is used wherein dystonia is the only motor feature apart from tremor, and the previously called heredodegenerative dystonias and dystonia plus syndromes are now subsumed under 'combined dystonia'. The recently discovered genes ANO3, GNAL and CIZ1 appear not to be a common cause of adult-onset cervical dystonia. Clinical and genetic heterogeneity underlie myoclonus-dystonia, dopa-responsive dystonia and deafness-dystonia syndrome. ALS2 gene mutations are a newly recognized cause for combined dystonia. The phenotypic and genotypic spectra of ATP1A3 mutations have considerably broadened. Two new genome-wide association studies identified new candidate genes. A retrospective analysis suggested complicated vaginal delivery as a modifying risk factor in DYT1. Recent studies confirm lasting therapeutic effects of deep brain stimulation in isolated dystonia, good treatment response in myoclonus-dystonia, and suggest that early treatment correlates with a better outcome.<h4>Summary</h4>Phenotypic classification continues to be important to recognize particular forms of dystonia and this includes syndromic associations. There are a number of genes underlying isolated or combined dystonia and there will be further new discoveries with the advances in genetic technologies such as exome and whole-genome sequencing. The identification of new genes will facilitate better elucidation of pathogenetic mechanisms and possible corrective therapies.""","""2014""","[""als2"", ""atp1a3"", ""tremor"", ""isolated dystonia"", ""dystonia plus syndromes"", ""myoclonus-dystonia"", ""dystonia"", ""deafness-dystonia syndrome"", ""dopa-responsive dystonia"", ""hereditary dystonias"", ""ano3"", ""gnal"", ""dystonias"", ""ciz1"", ""cervical dystonia"", ""dyt1""]"

The aim was to establish the motor phenotype in mutation carriers and utility of current diagnostic criteria. Eighty-nine probands with clinical features compatible with MDS were recruited from the UK and Ireland. Patients were phenotypically classified as \""definite\"", \""probable\"" or \""possible\"" MDS according to previous guidelines. SGCE was analyzed using direct sequencing and copy number variant analysis. In those where no mutation was found, DYT1 (GAG deletion), GCH1, THAP1 and NKX2.1 genes were also sequenced. Nineteen (21.3%) probands had an SGCE mutation. Three patterns of motor symptoms emerged: (1) early childhood onset upper body myoclonus and dystonia, (2) early childhood onset lower limb dystonia, progressing later to more pronounced myoclonus and upper body involvement, and (3) later childhood onset upper body myoclonus and dystonia with evident cervical involvement. Five probands had large contiguous gene deletions ranging from 0.7 to 2.3 Mb in size with distinctive clinical features, including short stature, joint laxity and microcephaly. Our data confirms that SGCE mutations are most commonly identified in MDS patients with (1) age at onset ≤10 years and (2) predominant upper body involvement of a pure myoclonus-dystonia.

As a secondary analysis, overlapping abnormalities were identified by comparisons to hereditary dystonias (DYT1, DYT6, dopa-responsive dystonia) and to posthypoxic myoclonus.<h4>Results</h4>We found significant DYT11 genotype-specific metabolic increases in the inferior pons and in the posterior thalamus as well as reductions in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Significant phenotype-related increases were present in the parasagittal cerebellum. This latter abnormality was shared with posthypoxic myoclonus, but not with other forms of dystonia.

Two dystonia patients from a single family with double mutations in DYT1 and SGCE exhibited more severe symptoms. A recent study suggested that torsinA contributes to the quality control of ε-sarcoglycan. Here, we derived mice carrying mutations in both Dyt1 and Sgce and found that these double mutant mice showed earlier onset of motor deficits in beam-walking test. A novel monoclonal antibody against mouse ε-sarcoglycan was developed by using Sgce knock-out mice to avoid the immune tolerance.

The subclassification of these patients included 344 with primary forms of dystonia, 10 with myoclonus dystonia, 19 with heredodegenerative dystonias and 93 who had DBS for secondary dystonia. Patients with primary forms of dystonia, myoclonus dystonia, subtypes of heredo-degenerative dystonia and tardive dystonia have a greater than 50% mean improvement in dystonia severity following DBS. Among patients with primary generalised dystonia, multiple regression analysis showed that a shorter duration of symptoms (p=0.008), a lower baseline severity score (p=0.024) and DYT1 positive status (p=0.002) were all independently associated with a significantly higher percentage improvement from surgery.

There is evidence that dysfunction of striatal parvalbumin-reactive (Parv+) fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) can be involved in dystonic signs. To elucidate the relevance of these GABAergic interneurons in the pathophysiology of DYT1 dystonia, we used in vivo optogenetics to specifically inhibit Parv+ and to detect changes in motor behavior and neuronal activity. Optogenetic fibers were bilaterally implanted into the dorsal striatum of male DYT1 KI mice and wild-type (WT) littermates expressing halorhodopsin (eNpHR3.0) in Parv+ interneurons. While stimulations with yellow light pulses for up to 60 min at different pulse durations and interval lengths did not induce abnormal movements, such as dystonic signs, immunohistochemical examinations revealed genotype-dependent differences. In contrast to WT mice, stimulated DYT1 KI showed decreased striatal neuronal activity, that is, less c-Fos reactive neurons, and increased activation of cholinergic interneurons after optogenetic inhibition of Parv+ interneurons. These findings suggest an involvement of Parv+ interneurons in an impaired striatal network in DYT1 KI mice, but at least short-term inhibition of these GABAergic interneurons is not sufficient to trigger a dystonic phenotype, similar to previously shown optogenetic activation of cholinergic interneurons.""","""2022""","[""parv"", ""c-fos"", ""dystonic"", ""parvalbumin"", ""dyt1"", ""mice"", ""torsion dystonia"", ""tor1a"", ""human"", ""dystonia"", ""subtle sensorimotor deficits""]"

Functional alterations of the basal ganglia circuits have been implicated in this disease. Striatal dopamine receptor 2 (D2R) levels are significantly decreased in DYT1 dystonia patients and in the animal models of DYT1 dystonia. D2R-expressing cells, such as the medium spiny neurons in the indirect pathway, striatal cholinergic interneurons, and dopaminergic neurons in the basal ganglia circuits, contribute to motor performance. However, the function of torsinA in these neurons and its contribution to the motor symptoms is not clear. Here, D2R-expressing-cell-specific Dyt1 conditional knockout (d2KO) mice were generated and in vivo effects of torsinA loss in the corresponding cells were examined. The Dyt1 d2KO mice showed significant reductions of striatal torsinA, acetylcholine metabolic enzymes, Tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA), and cholinergic interneurons. The Dyt1 d2KO mice also showed significant reductions of striatal D2R dimers and tyrosine hydroxylase without significant alteration in striatal monoamine contents or the number of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. The Dyt1 d2KO male mice showed motor deficits in the accelerated rotarod and beam-walking tests without overt dystonic symptoms. Moreover, the Dyt1 d2KO male mice showed significant correlations between striatal monoamines and locomotion. The results suggest that torsinA in the D2R-expressing cells play a critical role in the development or survival of the striatal cholinergic interneurons, expression of striatal D2R mature form, and motor performance.

Symptoms typically appear during childhood, suggesting the presence of an early critical period of sensorimotor circuit susceptibility to torsinA dysfunction. Here, we identified in two different DYT1 mouse strains, heterozygous torsinA knockout mice (Tor1a+/-) and human ΔGAG mutant torsinA transgenic mice (hMT), the anatomical abnormalities in the cerebellum, during a critical age for synaptogenesis (postnatal day 14, P14). By means of immunofluorescence, confocal analysis and western blot quantification, we observed a reduced inhibitory input on Purkinje cells (PCs) as well as an unbalanced excitatory innervation; a significant reduction of the parallel fiber (PF) synaptic terminals and an increase of the climbing fiber (CF) inputs. Finally, in support of the in vivo results, we also provide evidence of an impaired PF synaptogenesis in a co-culture system. Of note, these alterations were rescued and in part over-compensated in the adult age in both mouse strains, suggesting that torsinA dysfunction can induce an altered maturation of cerebellar synaptic contacts.

The excitability of ChIs may be modulated by group I metabotropic glutamate receptor subtypes (mGlu1 and 5). We performed electrophysiological and calcium imaging recordings from ChIs of both knock-in mice heterozygous for Δ-torsinA (Tor1a(+/Δgag) mice) and transgenic mice overexpressing human torsinA (hMT1). We demonstrate that the novel negative allosteric modulator (NAM) of metabotropic glutamate 5 (mGlu) receptor, dipraglurant (ADX48621) counteracts the abnormal membrane responses and calcium rise induced either by the D2R agonist quinpirole or by caged dopamine (NPEC-Dopamine) in both models.

Therefore, to better understand TA function a detailed description of its localization at synaptic level is required. Here, we characterized by means of rigorous quantitative confocal analysis TA distribution in the mouse cerebellum at postnatal day 14 (P14), when both cerebellar synaptogenesis and TA expression peak.

This method applies different concentrations of DA through the microdialysis probe and measures DA concentration at the output of the probe following an equilibrium period.

Abnormal activity in the pallidal-thalamic-cortical circuit, especially in the globus pallidus internus, is the proposed cause of dystonic symptoms. However, recent neuroimaging studies suggest significant contribution of the cerebral cortex. To understand the contribution of the cerebral cortex to dystonia, we produced cerebral cortex-specific Dyt1 conditional knockout mice and analysed their behaviour. The conditional knockout mice exhibited motor deficits and hyperactivity that mimic the reported behavioural deficits in Dyt1 DeltaGAG knockin heterozygous and Dyt1 knockdown mice. Although the latter two mice exhibit lower levels of dopamine metabolites in the striatum, the conditional knockout mice did not show significant alterations in the striatal dopamine and its metabolites levels. The conditional knockout mice had well-developed whisker-related patterns in somatosensory cortex, suggesting formations of synapses and neural circuits were largely unaffected. The results suggest that the loss of torsinA function in the cerebral cortex alone is sufficient to induce behavioural deficits associated with Dyt1 DeltaGAG knockin mutation.

This form of dystonia is referred to as DYT1. We have used a transgenic mouse model of DYT1 dystonia [human mutant-type (hMT)1 mice] to examine the effect of the mutant human torsinA protein on striatal dopaminergic function. Analysis of striatal tissue dopamine (DA) and metabolites using HPLC revealed no difference between hMT1 mice and their non-transgenic littermates. Pre-synaptic DA transporters were studied using in vitro autoradiography with [(3)H]mazindol, a ligand for the membrane DA transporter, and [(3)H]dihydrotetrabenazine, a ligand for the vesicular monoamine transporter. No difference in the density of striatal DA transporter or vesicular monoamine transporter binding sites was observed. Post-synaptic receptors were studied using [(3)H]SCH-23390, a ligand for D(1) class receptors, [(3)H]YM-09151-2 and a ligand for D(2) class receptors. There were again no differences in the density of striatal binding sites for these ligands. Using in vivo microdialysis in awake animals, we studied basal as well as amphetamine-stimulated striatal extracellular DA levels. Basal extracellular DA levels were similar, but the response to amphetamine was markedly attenuated in the hMT1 mice compared with their non-transgenic littermates (253 +/- 71% vs. 561 +/- 132%, p < 0.05, two-way anova). These observations suggest that the mutation in the torsinA protein responsible for DYT1 dystonia may interfere with transport or release of DA, but does not alter pre-synaptic transporters or post-synaptic DA receptors.

We used a sensitive reporter, Gaussia luciferase (Gluc) to evaluate the role of torsinA in processing proteins through the ER. In primary fibroblasts from controls and DYT1 patients most Gluc activity (95%) was released into the media and processed through the secretory pathway, as confirmed by inhibition with brefeldinA and nocodazole. Fusion of Gluc to a fluorescent protein revealed coalignment and fractionation with ER proteins and association of Gluc with torsinA. Notably, fibroblasts from DYT1 patients were found to secrete markedly less Gluc activity as compared with control fibroblasts. This decrease in processing of Gluc in DYT1 cells appear to arise, at least in part, from a loss of torsinA activity, because mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking torsinA also had reduced secretion as compared with control cells.

Moreover, the N-type component was significantly over-represented in hMT mice.

At 8 months, retesting revealed motor deficits in rotarod, beam walking, grip strength, and hyperactivity in the open field; however, no overt dystonia was visually discernible or through the machine learning-based video analysis.

In subjects with SD, due to  the delay of identification and  lacking prevention of trigger and precipitant factors, intensive care management is consistently required. OBJECTIVES:We performed a critical review of this topic, outlining clinical features and linked genetic disorders to recognize subject at higher risk of SD, describing precipitant and trigger factors and proposing potential pharmacological treatment strategies in order to prevent hospitalization. RESULTS:Genetic predisposition included: primary dystonias particularly in the case of  TOR1A mutation; epileptic encephalopathy such as ARX and GNAO1 genetic variants and neurodegenerative disorders as PANK2. Early recognition of SD should be oriented by the following sign and symptoms: fever, tachycardia, respiratory change, hypertension, sweating and autonomic instability, elevated serum CK. Pain, fever and dehydration are main trigger factors that have to be prevented or quickly controlled. Achieving sleep could be the first therapeutic option in those with high risk of developing SD.

Improvement in DYT-TOR1A was significantly greater than in DYT-THAP1 (BFMMS -31%), NBIA/DYT-PANK2 (BFMMS -35%; BFMDS -53%) and CHOR/DYT-ADCY5 (BFMMS -36%; BFMDS -42%). Worse motor outcomes were associated with longer dystonia duration and older age at dystonia onset in DYT-TOR1A, longer dystonia duration in DYT/PARK-TAF1 and younger age at dystonia onset in DYT-SGCE.

The previously reported examples of 9q33q34 microdeletion including STXBP1 are reviewed.<h4>Results</h4>The patient developed infantile spasms at 4 months of age, and these were refractory to multiple antiepileptic drugs. He also developed severe dystonia during infancy, rotatory nystagmus, and nephroureteral malformations. Immunoglobulin and clobazam administered at 11 months were effective for the spasms, but profound psychomotor retardation remained. A comparative genomic hybridization array analysis and the fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis revealed a de novo 2.0-Mb microdeletion in chromosome 9q33q34, which encompasses STXBP1, ENG, SPTAN1, and 52 other genes. A total of 14 patients (13 from the literature) with a 9q33q24 microdeletion including STXBP1 were reviewed, five of them displayed early infantile epileptic encephalopathy with suppression-burst, and six of them had early-onset epilepsy but not early infantile epileptic encephalopathy. Dystonia has been previously described in 9q33q34 deletions involving TOR1A but not STXBP1.

OBJECTIVE: To summarize current knowledge about movement disorders overrepresented among patients of Jewish ancestry. EVIDENCE REVIEW: We searched PubMed and the OMIM and Israeli National Genetic Databases for articles published from 1969 through March 31, 2014, using the search terms Parkinson's disease,movement disorders, ataxia, dystonia, chorea, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob with and Jewish. The final reference list was generated by giving priority to articles directly related to the topic, articles with the latest information, and comprehensive but relevant reviews. FINDINGS: About one-third of patients with sporadic Parkinson disease (PD) and more than 40% of patients with familial PD of Ashkenazi Jewish descent likely carry the G2019S mutation in the LRRK2 gene, a mutation in the glucocerebrosidase (GBA) gene, or both. This finding contrasts with only a 10% frequency of these mutations in patients with PD who are of non-Jewish ancestry. A dystonia due to a TOR1A gene mutation is responsible for most early-onset autosomal dominant dystonia, and 90% of Ashkenazi Jews who develop early-onset disease have TOR1A-related dystonia. Familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis tend to cluster among Jews of North African descent, and Machado-Joseph disease is particularly frequent in Yemenite Jews. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Genetic forms of PD are much more common in patients of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry with sporadic and familial PD than in the non-Jewish population. The recognition of the particular movement disorder phenotype, coupled with information about the ethnic origin of the patients, may point to specific genetic testing and lead to early and correct diagnosis.""","""2014""","[""tor1a"", ""familial creutzfeldt-jakob disease"", ""movement disorders"", ""human"", ""patients"", ""patient"", ""infant"", ""mammalian"", ""infants"", ""boy"", ""child"", ""woman"", ""humans"", ""children"", ""girl"", ""mammal"", ""boys"", ""participants"", ""women"", ""man"", ""donor"", ""persons"", ""men"", ""person"", ""people"", ""girls"", ""peoples"", ""participant"", ""outpatient"", ""donor variant"", ""patient variant"", ""mammalians"", ""homo sapiens"", ""pt"", ""homo sapiens linnaeus, 1758"", ""pts"", ""h. sapiens"", ""humans. subsp"", ""human pv"", ""hs"", ""mans"", ""patients. variant"", ""patients. str"", ""pats"", ""patients' variant"", ""mammalia"", ""children. pv"", ""p=ns"", ""human variant"", ""pns"", ""ch"", ""hsa"", ""patients, bv"", ""op"", ""child."", ""patients, pv"", ""patients."", ""patients,"", ""patients. pv"", ""para"", ""patients; str"", ""p = ns"", ""p =ns"", ""pten"", ""human bv"", ""ppl"", ""patients (variant"", ""humans, variant"", ""hu"", ""patients (pv"", ""patients pv"", ""humans, bv"", ""human biovar"", ""ptts"", ""pat"", ""patients (bv"", ""women. bv"", ""women. pv"", ""donor pv"", ""patient, variant"", ""human subspecies"", ""d+/r"", ""patients). pv"", ""patients; variant"", ""patient pv"", ""p"", ""patients), str"", ""pn"", ""gba"", ""cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis"", ""sporadic parkinson disease"", ""machado-joseph disease"", ""autosomal dominant dystonia"", ""lrrk2"", ""ataxia"", ""movement disorder"", ""dystonia"", ""pd"", ""parkinson's disease,movement disorders"", ""glucocerebrosidase"", ""chorea"", ""g2019s""]"

We aimed to induce dystonia-like symptoms in male ∆ETorA rats by peripheral nerve injury and to identify central mechanism of dystonia development. Dystonia-like movements (DLM) were assessed using the tail suspension test and implementing a pipeline of deep learning applications. Neuron numbers of striatal parvalbumin<sup>+</sup>, nNOS<sup>+</sup>, calretinin<sup>+</sup>, ChAT<sup>+</sup> interneurons and Nissl<sup>+</sup> cells were estimated by unbiased stereology. Striatal dopaminergic metabolism was analyzed via in vivo microdialysis, qPCR and western blot. Local field potentials (LFP) were recorded from the central motor network. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the entopeduncular nucleus (EP) was performed. Nerve-injured ∆ETorA rats developed long-lasting DLM over 12 weeks. No changes in striatal structure were observed. Dystonic-like ∆ETorA rats presented a higher striatal dopaminergic turnover and stimulus-induced elevation of dopamine efflux compared to the control groups. Higher LFP theta power in the EP of dystonic-like ∆ETorA compared to wt rats was recorded. Chronic EP-DBS over 3 weeks led to improvement of DLM. Our data emphasizes the role of environmental factors in TOR1A symptomatogenesis. LFP analyses indicate that the pathologically enhanced theta power is a physiomarker of DLM. This TOR1A model replicates key features of the human TOR1A pathology on multiple biological levels and is therefore suited for further analysis of dystonia pathomechanism.""","""2021""","[""tor1a"", ""dystonia"", ""parvalbumin"", ""dopamine"", ""chat"", ""nnos"", ""nerve injury"", ""rats"", ""rat"", ""sprague-dawley rats"", ""wistar rats"", ""gunn rats"", ""sprague dawley rats"", ""laboratory rats"", ""laboratory rat"", ""brown rat"", ""rattus norvegicus"", ""r. norvegicus"", ""norway rats"", ""brown rats"", ""sprague-dawley rat"", ""sprague dawley rat"", ""sdrs"", ""sdr"", ""norway rat"", ""laboratory"", ""rn"", ""sprague-dawley rat substrain"", ""spd"", ""wistar-rats"", ""sprague - dawley rats"", ""sprague dawley  rat"", ""wistar stra"", ""sprague-dawley stra"", ""wistar) rats"", ""buffalo rat"", ""rat pv"", ""sd rats"", ""sprague"", ""b-/- rats"", ""wr"", ""buffalo rats"", ""buf rats"", ""zitter rats"", ""sprague dawley) rat"", ""sprague dawley stra"", ""sd"", ""sprague-dawley  rats"", ""sprague dawley  rats"", ""sprague -dawley rats"", ""sprague-dawley-rat"", ""sprague- dawley rats"", ""laboratory, rats"", ""r.n"", ""g. rats"", ""rat variant"", ""b - rats"", ""dystonic"", ""calretinin"", ""human"", ""patients"", ""patient"", ""infant"", ""mammalian"", ""infants"", ""boy"", ""child"", ""woman"", ""humans"", ""children"", ""girl"", ""mammal"", ""boys"", ""participants"", ""women"", ""man"", ""donor"", ""persons"", ""men"", ""person"", ""people"", ""girls"", ""peoples"", ""participant"", ""outpatient"", ""donor variant"", ""patient variant"", ""mammalians"", ""homo sapiens"", ""pt"", ""homo sapiens linnaeus, 1758"", ""pts"", ""h. sapiens"", ""humans. subsp"", ""human pv"", ""hs"", ""mans"", ""patients. variant"", ""patients. str"", ""pats"", ""patients' variant"", ""mammalia"", ""children. pv"", ""p=ns"", ""human variant"", ""pns"", ""ch"", ""hsa"", ""patients, bv"", ""op"", ""child."", ""patients, pv"", ""patients."", ""patients,"", ""patients. pv"", ""para"", ""patients; str"", ""p = ns"", ""p =ns"", ""pten"", ""human bv"", ""ppl"", ""patients (variant"", ""humans, variant"", ""hu"", ""patients (pv"", ""patients pv"", ""humans, bv"", ""human biovar"", ""ptts"", ""pat"", ""patients (bv"", ""women. bv"", ""women. pv"", ""donor pv"", ""patient, variant"", ""human subspecies"", ""d+/r"", ""patients). pv"", ""patients; variant"", ""patient pv"", ""p"", ""patients), str"", ""pn""]"

Despite being a first-line testing tool for heterogeneous inherited disorders, whole-exome sequencing has not yet been evaluated in dystonia diagnostics. We set up a pilot study to address the yield of whole-exome sequencing for early-onset generalized dystonia, a disease subtype enriched for monogenic causation.<h4>Methods</h4>Clinical whole-exome sequencing coupled with bioinformatics analysis and detailed phenotyping of mutation carriers was performed on 16 consecutive cases with genetically undefined early-onset generalized dystonia. Candidate pathogenic variants were validated and tested for cosegregation. The whole-exome approach was complemented by analyzing 2 mutated yet unestablished causative genes in another 590 dystonia cases.<h4>Results</h4>Whole-exome sequencing detected clinically relevant mutations of known dystonia-related genes in 6 generalized dystonia cases (37.5%), among whom 3 had novel variants. Reflecting locus heterogeneity, identified unique variants were distributed over 5 genes (GCH1, THAP1, TOR1A, ANO3, ADCY5), of which only 1 (ANO3) was mutated recurrently. Three genes (GCH1, THAP1, TOR1A) were associated with isolated generalized dystonia, whereas 2 (ANO3, ADCY5) gave rise to combined dystonia-myoclonus phenotypes. Follow-up screening of ANO3 and ADCY5 revealed a set of distinct variants of interest, the pathogenicity of which was supported by bioinformatics testing and cosegregation work.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our study identified whole-exome sequencing as an effective strategy for molecular diagnosis of early-onset generalized dystonia and offers insights into the heterogeneous genetic architecture of this condition. Furthermore, it provides confirmatory evidence for a dystonia-relevant role of ANO3 and ADCY5, both of which likely associate with a broader spectrum of dystonic expressions than previously thought. © 2016 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.""","""2016""","[""dystonia"", ""tor1a"", ""inherited disorders"", ""gch1"", ""parkinson and movement disorder"", ""dystonia-myoclonus"", ""thap1"", ""generalized dystonia"", ""adcy5"", ""ano3"", ""dystonic""]"

It followed MDSGene's standardized data extraction protocol and screened a total of ~1200 citations. Phenotypic and genotypic data on ~1200 patients with 254 different mutations were curated and analyzed. There were differences regarding age at onset, site of onset, and distribution of symptoms across mutation carriers in all 7 genes. Although carriers of TOR1A, THAP1, PRKRA, KMT2B, or HPCA mutations mostly showed childhood and adolescent onset, patients with GNAL and ANO3 mutations often developed first symptoms in adulthood. GNAL and KMT2B mutation carriers frequently have 1 predominant site of onset, that is, the neck (GNAL) or the lower limbs (KMT2B), whereas site of onset in DYT-TOR1A, DYT-THAP1, DYT-ANO3, DYT-PRKRA, and DYT-HPCA was broader. However, in most DYT-THAP1 and DYT-ANO3 patients, dystonia first manifested in the upper half of the body (upper limb, neck, and craniofacial/laryngeal), whereas onset in DYT-TOR1A, DYT-PRKRA and DYT-HPCA was frequently observed in an extremity, including both upper and lower ones. For ANO3, a segmental/multifocal distribution was typical, whereas TOR1A, PRKRA, KMT2B, and HPCA mutation carriers commonly developed generalized dystonia. THAP1 mutation carriers presented with focal, segmental/multifocal, or generalized dystonia in almost equal proportions. GNAL mutation carriers rarely showed generalization.

Although pathogenic variants to the familial type of dystonia have been extensively reviewed and discussed, relatively little is known about the contribution of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to dystonia. This review focuses on the potential role of SNPs and other variants in dystonia susceptibility.<h4>Methods</h4>We searched the PubMed database for peer-reviewed articles published in English, from its inception through January 2018, that concerned human studies of dystonia and genetic variants. The following search terms were included: \""dystonia\"" in combination with the following terms: 1) \""polymorphisms\"" and 2) \""SNPs\"" as free words.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 43 published studies regarding <i>TOR1A</i>, <i>BDNF</i>, <i>DRD5</i>, <i>APOE</i>, <i>ARSG</i>, <i>NALC</i>, <i>OR4X2</i>, <i>COL4A1</i>, <i>TH</i>, <i>DDC</i>, <i>DBH</i>, <i>MAO</i>, COMT, <i>DAT</i>, <i>GCH1</i>, <i>PRKRA</i>, <i>MR-1</i>, <i>SGCE</i>, <i>ATP1A3</i>, <i>TAF1</i>, <i>THAP1</i>, <i>GNAL</i>, <i>DRD2</i>, <i>HLA-DRB</i>, <i>CBS</i>, <i>MTHFR</i>, and <i>MS</i> genes, were included in the current review.<h4>Discussion</h4>To date, a few variants, which are possibly involved in several molecular pathways, have been related to dystonia. Large cohort studies are needed to determine robust associations between variants and dystonia with adjustment for other potential cofounders, in order to elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms of dystonia and the net effect of the genes.""","""2018""","[""hla-drb"", ""tor1a"", ""arsg"", ""atp1a3"", ""mthfr"", ""gnal"", ""human"", ""patients"", ""patient"", ""infant"", ""mammalian"", ""infants"", ""boy"", ""child"", ""woman"", ""humans"", ""children"", ""girl"", ""mammal"", ""boys"", ""participants"", ""women"", ""man"", ""donor"", ""persons"", ""men"", ""person"", ""people"", ""girls"", ""peoples"", ""participant"", ""outpatient"", ""donor variant"", ""patient variant"", ""mammalians"", ""homo sapiens"", ""pt"", ""homo sapiens linnaeus, 1758"", ""pts"", ""h. sapiens"", ""humans. subsp"", ""human pv"", ""hs"", ""mans"", ""patients. variant"", ""patients. str"", ""pats"", ""patients' variant"", ""mammalia"", ""children. pv"", ""p=ns"", ""human variant"", ""pns"", ""ch"", ""hsa"", ""patients, bv"", ""op"", ""child."", ""patients, pv"", ""patients."", ""patients,"", ""patients. pv"", ""para"", ""patients; str"", ""p = ns"", ""p =ns"", ""pten"", ""human bv"", ""ppl"", ""patients (variant"", ""humans, variant"", ""hu"", ""patients (pv"", ""patients pv"", ""humans, bv"", ""human biovar"", ""ptts"", ""pat"", ""patients (bv"", ""women. bv"", ""women. pv"", ""donor pv"", ""patient, variant"", ""human subspecies"", ""d+/r"", ""patients). pv"", ""patients; variant"", ""patient pv"", ""p"", ""patients), str"", ""pn"", ""dystonia"", ""apoe"", ""movement disorder"", ""cbs"", ""prkra"", ""sgce"", ""or4x2"", ""comt"", ""drd5"", ""gch1"", ""familial type of dystonia"", ""mr-1"", ""taf1"", ""dbh"", ""col4a1"", ""dat"", ""bdnf"", ""drd2"", ""thap1""]"

Our understanding of the correlation between genotype and phenotype is becoming increasingly complicated.<h4>Case presentations</h4>Here, we report on monozygotic twins who developed dystonia in childhood. The two children had different presentations in terms of onset age and dominant disturbances, but both exhibited marked diurnal fluctuation and jerking movements of the limbs as well as levodopa/levodopa-carbidopa responsiveness. These features are commonly associated with DYT/PARK-GCH1 and DYT-SGCE, yet these twins had no mutations in the GCH1 or SGCE genes. Whole exome sequencing eventually revealed a single GAG deletion in the TOR1A gene.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Monozygotic twins whose only mutation was a GAG deletion in TOR1A exhibited DYT/PARK-GCH1-asssociated features and jerking movements reminiscent of myoclonus.

Autosomal dominant torsion dystonia-1 is a disease with incomplete penetrance most often caused by an in-frame GAG deletion (p.Glu303del) in the endoplasmic reticulum luminal protein torsinA encoded by TOR1A. We report an association of the homozygous dominant disease-causing TOR1A p.Glu303del mutation, and a novel homozygous missense variant (p.Gly318Ser) with a severe arthrogryposis phenotype with developmental delay, strabismus and tremor in three unrelated Iranian families. All parents who were carriers of the TOR1A variant showed no evidence of neurological symptoms or signs, indicating decreased penetrance similar to families with autosomal dominant torsion dystonia-1. The results from cell assays demonstrate that the p.Gly318Ser substitution causes a redistribution of torsinA from the endoplasmic reticulum to the nuclear envelope, similar to the hallmark of the p.Glu303del mutation.

We found that these mice recapitulated the phenotype of the human condition, developing early-onset generalized torsional dystonia. Motor signs emerged early in the mouse hindlimbs before spreading caudo-rostrally to affect the pelvis, trunk, and forelimbs throughout postnatal maturation. Physiologically, these mice bore the hallmark features of dystonia, including spontaneous contractions at rest and excessive and disorganized contractions, including cocontractions of antagonist muscle groups, during voluntary movements. Spontaneous activity, disorganized motor output, and impaired monosynaptic reflexes, all signs of human dystonia, were recorded from isolated mouse spinal cords from these conditional knockout mice. All components of the monosynaptic reflex arc were affected, including motor neurons. Given that confining the <i>Tor1a</i> conditional knockout to DRG did not lead to early-onset dystonia, we conclude that the pathophysiological substrate of this mouse model of dystonia lies in spinal neural circuits.

Most DYT1 patients have a heterozygous trinucleotide GAG deletion mutation (<i>ΔGAG</i>) in <i>DYT1/TOR1A,</i> coding for torsinA. <i>Dyt1</i> heterozygous ΔGAG knock-in (KI) mice show motor deficits and reduced striatal dopamine receptor 2 (D2R). Striatal cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) are essential in regulating striatal motor circuits. Multiple dystonia rodent models, including KI mice, show altered ChI firing and modulation. However, due to the errors in assigning KI mice, it is essential to replicate these findings in genetically confirmed KI mice. Here, we found irregular and decreased spontaneous firing frequency in the acute brain slices from <i>Dyt1</i> KI mice. Quinpirole, a D2R agonist, showed less inhibitory effect on the spontaneous ChI firing in <i>Dyt1</i> KI mice, suggesting decreased D2R function on the striatal ChIs. On the other hand, a muscarinic receptor agonist, muscarine, inhibited the ChI firing in both wild-type (WT) and <i>Dyt1</i> KI mice. Trihexyphenidyl, a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M1 antagonist, had no significant effect on the firing. Moreover, the resting membrane property and functions of hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels, μ-opioid receptors, and large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channels were unaffected in <i>Dyt1</i> KI mice.

Among the few therapeutic options, broad-spectrum antimuscarinic drugs are utilized, aimed at counteracting abnormal striatal acetylcholine-mediated transmission, which plays a crucial role in dystonia pathophysiology. We previously demonstrated a complete loss of long-term synaptic depression (LTD) at corticostriatal synapses in rodent models of two distinct forms of isolated dystonia, resulting from mutations in the TOR1A (DYT1), and GNAL (DYT25) genes. In addition to anticholinergic agents, the aberrant excitability of striatal cholinergic cells can be modulated by group I metabotropic glutamate receptor subtypes (mGlu1 and 5). Here, we tested the efficacy of the negative allosteric modulator (NAM) of metabotropic glutamate 5 (mGlu) receptor, dipraglurant (ADX48621) on striatal LTD. We show that, whereas acute treatment failed to rescue LTD, chronic dipraglurant rescued this form of synaptic plasticity both in DYT1 mice and GNAL rats. Our analysis of the pharmacokinetic profile of dipraglurant revealed a relatively short half-life, which led us to uncover a peculiar time-course of recovery based on the timing from last dipraglurant injection.

Molecularly, it is characterized by hyper-induction of phosphorylation of extracellular signal-related kinase in response to dopamine in medium spiny neurons of the direct pathway.<h4>Objectives</h4>The objective of this study was to determine if mouse models of monogenic dystonia exhibit molecular features of levodopa-induced dyskinesia.<h4>Methods</h4>Western blotting and quantitative immunofluorescence was used to assay baseline and/or dopamine-induced levels of the phosphorylated kinase in the striatum in mouse models of DYT1, DYT6, and DYT25 expressing a reporter in dopamine D1 receptor-expressing projection neurons. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) immunoassay and adenylyl cyclase activity assays were also performed.<h4>Results</h4>In DYT1 and DYT6 models, blocking dopamine reuptake with cocaine leads to enhanced extracellular signal-related kinase phosphorylation in dorsomedial striatal medium spiny neurons in the direct pathway, which is abolished by pretreatment with the N-methyl-d-aspartate antagonist MK-801. Phosphorylation is decreased in a model of DYT25. Levels of basal and stimulated cAMP and adenylyl cyclase activity were normal in the DYT1 and DYT6 mice and decreased in the DYT25 mice. Oxotremorine induced increased abnormal movements in the DYT1 knock-in mice.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The increased dopamine induction of extracellular signal-related kinase phosphorylation in 2 genetic types of dystonia, similar to what occurs in levodopa-induced dyskinesia, and its decrease in a third, suggests that abnormal signal transduction in response to dopamine in the postsynaptic nigrostriatal pathway might be a point of convergence for dystonia and other hyperkinetic movement disorders, potentially offering common therapeutic targets. © 2021 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.""","""2021""","[""dyt1"", ""oxotremorine"", ""cocaine"", ""erk"", ""n-methyl-d-aspartate"", ""camp"", ""mice"", ""mouse"", ""murine"", ""transgenic mice"", ""nude mice"", ""transgenic"", ""mice (pv"", ""mus musculus"", ""house mouse"", ""m. musculus"", ""129/sv"", ""mmu"", ""t/+ mice"", ""mice,"", ""129sv"", ""n/+ mice"", ""mouse variant"", ""mice."", ""mouse:"", ""129 sv"", ""tgm"", ""house mouse subspecies"", ""tg mice"", ""mouse strain"", ""tg"", ""mice. pv"", ""mice. bv"", ""h-/- mouse"", ""mouse substrain"", ""transgenic) mice"", ""t. mice"", ""tr"", ""m:c"", ""mo"", ""h/+ mouse"", ""mice (strain"", ""mu"", ""nude\"" mice"", ""murine str"", ""mouses"", ""nude             mice"", ""tg-mice"", ""transgenic-mice"", ""nm"", ""n (+/+) mice"", ""n(-/-)) mice"", ""n(-/-) mice"", ""mouse biovar"", ""n  mice"", ""mouse subspecies"", ""h mouse"", ""mice. variant"", ""tm"", ""mus musculus,"", ""transgenic, mice"", ""nude-mice"", ""m. m"", ""hyperkinetic movement disorders"", ""dyskinesia"", ""levodopa"", ""adenosine"", ""mk-801"", ""dopamine d1 receptor"", ""dystonia"", ""dopamine"", ""hyperkinetic movement disorder"", ""parkinson and movement disorder""]"

To define the temporal requirements for torsinA in normal motor function and gene replacement therapy, we developed a mouse line enabling spatiotemporal control of the endogenous torsinA allele.

Dystonia is often accompanied by pain, and neuropathic pain can be associated to peripherally induced movement disorder and dystonia. However, no evidence exists on the effect of gabapentin in mice subjected to neuropathic pain model overexpressing human normal or mutated TA.<h4>Methods</h4>Mice subjected to L5 spinal nerve ligation (SNL) develop mechanical allodynia and upregulation of the α2δ-1 L-type calcium channel subunit, forming a validated experimental model of neuropathic pain. Under these experimental conditions, TA is expressed in dorsal horn neurons and astrocytes and colocalizes with α2δ-1. Similar to this subunit, TA is overexpressed in dorsal horn 7 days after SNL. This model has been used to investigate (1) basal mechanical sensitivity; (2) neuropathic pain phases; and (3) the effect of gabapentin, an α2δ-1 ligand used against neuropathic pain, in non-transgenic (NT) C57BL/6 mice and in mice overexpressing human wild-type (hWT) or mutant (hMT) TA.<h4>Results</h4>In comparison to non-transgenic mice, the threshold for mechanical sensitivity in hWT or hMT does not differ (Kruskal-Wallis test = 1.478; <i>p</i> = 0.4777, although, in the latter animals, neuropathic pain recovery phase is delayed.

Although the mechanisms underlying the dystonic movements are largely unknown, abnormalities in striatal dopamine and acetylcholine neurotransmission are consistently implicated whereby dopamine release is reduced while cholinergic tone is increased. Because striatal cholinergic neurotransmission mediates dopamine release, it is not known if the dopamine release deficit is mediated indirectly by abnormal acetylcholine neurotransmission or if Tor1a(ΔE) acts directly within dopaminergic neurons to attenuate release. To dissect the microcircuit that governs the deficit in dopamine release, we conditionally expressed Tor1a(ΔE) in either dopamine neurons or cholinergic interneurons in mice and assessed striatal dopamine release using ex vivo fast scan cyclic voltammetry or dopamine efflux using in vivo microdialysis. Conditional expression of Tor1a(ΔE) in cholinergic neurons did not affect striatal dopamine release. In contrast, conditional expression of Tor1a(ΔE) in dopamine neurons reduced dopamine release to 50% of normal, which is comparable to the deficit in Tor1a<sup>+/ΔE</sup> knockin mice that express the mutation ubiquitously. Despite the deficit in dopamine release, we found that the Tor1a(ΔE) mutation does not cause obvious nerve terminal dysfunction as other presynaptic mechanisms, including electrical excitability, vesicle recycling/refilling, Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, D2 dopamine autoreceptor function and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor function, are intact.

However, the nature of such alteration remains unclear.<h4>Objective</h4>The aim of the present work was to characterize the mechanistic basis of cholinergic dysfunction in DYT1 dystonia to identify potential targets for pharmacological intervention.<h4>Methods</h4>We utilized electrophysiology recordings, immunohistochemistry, enzymatic activity assays, and Western blotting techniques to analyze in detail the cholinergic machinery in the dorsal striatum of the Tor1a<sup>+/-</sup> mouse model of DYT1 dystonia.<h4>Results</h4>We found a significant increase in the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) protein level, the protein responsible for loading acetylcholine (ACh) from the cytosol into synaptic vesicles, which indicates an altered cholinergic tone. Accordingly, in Tor1a<sup>+/-</sup> mice we measured a robust elevation in basal ACh content coupled to a compensatory enhancement of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzymatic activity. Moreover, pharmacological activation of dopamine D2 receptors, which is expected to reduce ACh levels, caused an abnormal elevation in its content, as compared to controls. Patch-clamp recordings revealed a reduced effect of AChE inhibitors on cholinergic interneuron excitability, whereas muscarinic autoreceptor function was preserved. Finally, we tested the hypothesis that blockade of VAChT could restore corticostriatal long-term synaptic plasticity deficits. Vesamicol, a selective VAChT inhibitor, rescued a normal expression of synaptic plasticity.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Overall, our findings indicate that VAChT is a key player in the alterations of striatal plasticity and a novel target to normalize cholinergic dysfunction observed in DYT1 dystonia. © 2021 The Authors.

In the current study, we expanded this research field by investigating the critical role of ER stress underlying synaptic plasticity impairment imposed by mutant heterozygous Tor1a<sup>+/-</sup> in a DYT1 dystonia mouse model.<h4>Methods</h4>Heterozygous Tor1a<sup>+/-</sup> mouse model for DYT1 dystonia was established. Wild-type (Tor1a<sup>+/+</sup>, N=10) and mutant (Tor1a<sup>+/-</sup>, N=10) mice from post-natal day P25 to P35 were randomly distributed to experimental and control groups. Patch-clamp and current-clamp recordings of SPNs were conducted with intracellular electrodes for electrophysiological analyses. Striatal changes of the direct and indirect pathways were investigated via immunofluorescence. Golgi-Cox staining was conducted to observe spine morphology of SPNs. To quantify postsynaptic signaling proteins in striatum, RNA-Seq, qRT-PCR and WB were performed in striatal tissues.<h4>Results</h4>Long-term depression (LTD) was failed to be induced, while long-term potentiation (LTP) was further strengthened in striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs) from the Tor1a<sup>+/-</sup> DYT1 dystonia mice. Spine morphology analyses revealed a significant increase of both number of mushroom type spines and spine width in Tor1a<sup>+/-</sup> SPNs.

We now know that homozygosity for ΔGAG has the same effects as Tor1a<sup>KO</sup> , implicating a partial loss of function mechanism in the ΔGAG/+ disease state. In addition, torsinA loss specifically affects neurons in mice, even though the gene is broadly expressed, apparently because of differential expression of homologous torsinB. Furthermore, certain neuronal subtypes are more severely affected by torsinA loss. Interestingly, these include striatal cholinergic interneurons that display abnormal responses to dopamine in several Tor1a animal models. There is also progress on understanding torsinA molecular cell biology. The structural basis of how ΔGAG inhibits torsinA ATPase activity is defined, although mutant torsinA<sup>ΔGAG</sup> protein also displays some characteristics suggesting it contributes to dystonia by a gain-of-function mechanism. Furthermore, a consistent relationship is emerging between torsin dysfunction and membrane biology, including an evolutionarily conserved regulation of lipid metabolism.

To test this hypothesis, we performed proteomic analysis on nuclear and cytosolic subcellular fractions from DYT-TOR1A and wildtype mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). We further examined the compartmental proteomes following exposure to thapsigargin (Tg), an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stressor, because DYT-TOR1A dystonia models have previously shown abnormalities in cellular stress responses. Across both subcellular compartments, proteomes of DYT-TOR1A cells showed basal state disruptions consistent with an activated stress response, and in response to thapsigargin, a blunted stress response. However, the DYT-TOR1A nuclear proteome under Tg cell stress showed the most pronounced and disproportionate degree of protein disruptions - 3-fold greater than all other conditions. The affected proteins extended beyond those typically associated with stress responses, including enrichments for processes critical for neuronal synaptic function.

Mutations in the gene encoding epsilon-sarcoglycan (SGCE) have been found in some patients with MDS. SGCE is a maternally imprinted gene with the disease being inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern with reduced penetrance upon maternal transmission. In the central nervous system, epsilon-sarcoglycan is widely expressed in neurons of the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, hippocampus, cerebellum and the olfactory bulb. epsilon-Sarcoglycan is located at the plasma membrane in neurons, muscle and transfected cells. To determine the effect of MDS-associated mutations on the function of epsilon-sarcoglycan we examined the biosynthesis and trafficking of wild-type and mutant proteins in cultured cells. In contrast to the wild-type protein, disease-associated epsilon-sarcoglycan missense mutations (H36P, H36R and L172R) produce proteins that are undetectable at the cell surface and are retained intracellularly. These mutant proteins become polyubiquitinated and are rapidly degraded by the proteasome. Furthermore, torsinA, that is mutated in DYT1 dystonia, a rare type of primary dystonia, binds to and promotes the degradation of epsilon-sarcoglycan mutants when both proteins are co-expressed. These data demonstrate that some MDS-associated mutations in SGCE impair trafficking of the mutant protein to the plasma membrane and suggest a role for torsinA and the ubiquitin proteasome system in the recognition and processing of misfolded epsilon-sarcoglycan.""","""2007""","[""h36p"", ""epsilon-sarcoglycan"", ""human"", ""patients"", ""patient"", ""infant"", ""mammalian"", ""infants"", ""boy"", ""child"", ""woman"", ""humans"", ""children"", ""girl"", ""mammal"", ""boys"", ""participants"", ""women"", ""man"", ""donor"", ""persons"", ""men"", ""person"", ""people"", ""girls"", ""peoples"", ""participant"", ""outpatient"", ""donor variant"", ""patient variant"", ""mammalians"", ""homo sapiens"", ""pt"", ""homo sapiens linnaeus, 1758"", ""pts"", ""h. sapiens"", ""humans. subsp"", ""human pv"", ""hs"", ""mans"", ""patients. variant"", ""patients. str"", ""pats"", ""patients' variant"", ""mammalia"", ""children. pv"", ""p=ns"", ""human variant"", ""pns"", ""ch"", ""hsa"", ""patients, bv"", ""op"", ""child."", ""patients, pv"", ""patients."", ""patients,"", ""patients. pv"", ""para"", ""patients; str"", ""p = ns"", ""p =ns"", ""pten"", ""human bv"", ""ppl"", ""patients (variant"", ""humans, variant"", ""hu"", ""patients (pv"", ""patients pv"", ""humans, bv"", ""human biovar"", ""ptts"", ""pat"", ""patients (bv"", ""women. bv"", ""women. pv"", ""donor pv"", ""patient, variant"", ""human subspecies"", ""d+/r"", ""patients). pv"", ""patients; variant"", ""patient pv"", ""p"", ""patients), str"", ""pn"", ""myoclonus-dystonia syndrome"", ""sgce"", ""psychiatric"", ""l172r"", ""myoclonic jerks"", ""mds"", ""epilepsy"", ""h36r"", ""dyt1 dystonia"", ""torsina"", ""dystonia""]"

Their prevalence is difficult to determine. In our experience 80-90% of all dystonias are primary. About 20-30% of those have a genetic background; 10-20% are secondary, with tardive dystonia and dystonia in cerebral palsy being the most common forms. If dystonia in spastic conditions is accepted as secondary dystonia, this is the most common form of all dystonia. In primary dystonias, the dystonic movements are the only symptoms. In secondary dystonias, dystonic movements result from exogenous processes directly or indirectly affecting brain parenchyma. They may be caused by focal and diffuse brain damage, drugs, chemical agents, physical interactions with the central nervous system, and indirect central nervous system effects. Dystonia-plus syndromes describe brain parenchyma processes producing predominantly dystonia together with other movement disorders. They include dopa-responsive dystonia and myoclonus-dystonia. Heredodegenerative dystonias are dystonic movements occurring in the context of other heredodegenerative disorders. They may be caused by impaired energy metabolism, impaired systemic metabolism, storage of noxious substances, oligonucleotid repeats and other processes. Pseudodystonias mimic dystonia and include psychogenic dystonia and various orthopedic, ophthalmologic, vestibular, and traumatic conditions. Unusual manifestations, unusual age of onset, suspect family history, suspect medical history, and additional signs may indicate nonprimary dystonia. If they are suspected, etiological clarification becomes necessary. Unfortunately, potential etiologies are legion. Diagnostic algorithms can be helpful. Treatment of nonprimary dystonias, with few exceptions, does not differ from treatment of primary dystonias. The most effective treatment for focal and segmental dystonias is local botulinum toxin injections. Deep brain stimulation of the globus pallidus internus is effective for generalized dystonia. Antidystonic drugs, including anticholinergics, tetrabenazine, clozapine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor agonists, are less effective and often produce adverse effects. Dopamine is extremely effective in dopa-responsive dystonia. The Bertrand procedure can be effective in cervical dystonia. Other peripheral surgery, including myotomy, myectomy, neurotomy, rhizotomy, ramizectomy, and accessory nerve neurolysis, has largely been abandoned. Central surgery other than deep brain stimulation is obsolete.

To date, 19 different forms of monogenic dystonia (primary dystonias and dystonia-plus syndromes) have been identified and classified as DYT loci.

While gross brain lesions can produce secondary dystonias, advanced neuroimaging techniques have been required to identify network abnormalities in primary dystonias. Prior neuroimaging studies have provided valuable insights into the pathophysiology of dystonia, but few directly assessed the gross volume of motor control regions, and to our knowledge, none identified abnormalities common to multiple types of idiopathic focal dystonia.<h4>Methods</h4>We used two gross volumetric segmentation techniques and one voxelwise volumetric technique (voxel based morphometry, VBM) to compare regional volume between matched healthy controls and patients with idiopathic primary focal dystonia (cervical, n = 17, laryngeal, n = 7). We used (1) automated gross volume measures of eight motor control regions using the FreeSurfer analysis package; (2) blinded, anatomist-supervised manual segmentation of the whole thalamus (also gross volume); and (3) voxel based morphometry, which measures local T1-weighted signal intensity and estimates gray matter density or volume at the level of single voxels, for both whole-brain and thalamus.<h4>Results</h4>Using both automated and manual gross volumetry, we found a significant volume decrease only in the thalamus in two focal dystonias. Decreases in whole-thalamic volume were independent of head and brain size, laterality of symptoms, and duration. VBM measures did not differ between dystonia and control groups in any motor control region.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Reduced thalamic gross volume, detected in two independent analyses, suggests a common anatomical abnormality in cervical dystonia and spasmodic dysphonia.

It is characterized by involuntary convulsive muscle contractions of the M. orbicularis occuli, accompanied by unbearable pain of the cornea, eye bulb and the muscle itself. It has been suggested that blepharospasm is neurobiologically based on a dysfunction of the basal ganglia and an impairment of the dopamine neurotransmitter system. Therefore, therapy of blepharospasm contains administration of anticholinergic- and tranquillizing drugs as well as botulinum toxin as neuromuscular blocking agent. However serious side effects can be observed as well as failure of therapy. In the brain a dense co-localisation of cannabinoid (CB1) and dopamine (D2)-receptor was identified which had been associated with the influence of cannabinoids on the dopaminergic reward system. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that cannabinoids may have an impact on the central GABAergic and glutaminergic transmitter system and thus might be involved in the influence of movement control. In the present case we administered the cannabinoid receptor agonist Dronabinol (Delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol) to a woman suffering from severe blepharospasm.

We aimed to compare the sensitivity and specificity of three different TDT tasks (visual, tactile and mixed/visual-tactile). We also aimed to examine the sensitivity of TDTs in different AOPTD phenotypes. To examine tasks, we tested TDT in 41 patients and 51 controls using visual (2 lights), tactile (non-painful electrical stimulation) and mixed (1 light, 1 electrical) stimuli. To investigate phenotypes, we examined 71 AOPTD patients (37 cervical dystonia, 14 writer's cramp, 9 blepharospasm, 11 spasmodic dysphonia) and 8 musician's dystonia patients. The upper limit of normal was defined as control mean +2.5 SD.

We systematically examined familial Amish-Mennonite dystonia cases, identifying five additional members from the original families, as well as three other multiplex Amish-Mennonite families, and evaluated the known DYT6 haplotype and recombination events. One of the three new families carried the shared haplotype, whereas the region was excluded in the two other families, suggesting genetic heterogeneity for PTD in the Amish-Mennonites. Clinical features in the five newly identified DYT6 carriers were similar to those initially described. In contrast, affected individuals from the excluded families had a later age of onset (46.9 years vs. 16.1 years in the DYT6), and the dystonia was both more likely to be of focal distribution and begin in the cervical muscles. Typing of additional markers in the DYT6-linked families revealed recombinations that now place the gene in a 23 cM region surrounding the centromere.

"""21907099""","""Genetics and pharmacological treatment of dystonia.""","""Dystonia consists of involuntary repetitive twisting (torsion) or directional movements, sometimes leading to sustained postures. The movements are stereotyped and characterized by co-contraction of agonist and antagonist muscles. There is a broad clinical spectrum of dystonia which derives in part from the differential distribution of involvement. Dystonia may be localized, affecting a single body region, or generalized, affecting multiple extremities along with the trunk. Intermediate dystonic involvement can be described as segmental, designating two affected contiguous body regions, or multifocal, designating two or more noncontiguous affected body regions. Hemidystonia refers to dystonia affecting only one side of the body. Dystonia can also be categorized by age of onset and etiology. Early onset dystonia, occurring in childhood or adolescence (in some studies younger than 26 years old), is associated with more progressive disease [Greene et al. (1995). Mov. Disord. 10, 143]. In this age group, dystonia usually first appears in a limb and then spreads to involve other limbs and axial muscles; some early-onset patients may have involvement of laryngeal and other cranial muscles. Adult or late-onset dystonia typically begins in the neck, arm, or cranial muscles. Compared to early-onset dystonia, the area of involvement is more likely to remain focal or segmental. Dystonia can be considered either primary or nonprimary. Primary torsion dystonia (PTD), historically called dystonia musculorum deformans and Oppenheim's dystonia, describes dystonia in isolation, excepting tremor, without brain degeneration and without an identified acquired cause. Nonprimary or secondary dystonia encompasses a heterogeneous group of syndromes and etiologies including inherited (with or without brain degeneration), acquired, and complex neurological disorders. Monogenic forms of dystonia are labeled DYT and enumerated in the order in which they were discovered. The current 20 DYT loci comprise a heterogeneous group of disorders. (Table I) They can be divided into PTDs, dystonia-plus syndromes without brain degeneration, dystonia-parkinsonism with brain degeneration (i.e. DYT3), and paroxysmal dyskinesias. There are many neurodegenerative genetic disorders that share dystonia as a common feature of disease (Table II).

Lesion localization and type, patient age, patient gender, head position, occurrence of sensory tricks, and associated neurological findings were tabulated for each case. Structural lesions associated with cervical dystonia were most commonly localized to the brainstem and cerebellum. The remaining cases were equally divided between the cervical spinal cord and basal ganglia. Although inconsistent, head rotation tended to be contralateral to lesion localization. Additional neurological abnormalities were present in the majority of patients with secondary cervical dystonia. The relative paucity of basal ganglia pathology and concentration of lesions in the brainstem, cerebellum, and cervical spinal cord in patients with secondary cervical dystonia suggests that dysfunction of cerebellar afferent pathways may be important to the pathophysiology of primary cervical dystonia.""","""2003""","[""neurological abnormalities"", ""head rotation"", ""structural lesions"", ""patient"", ""axial dystonias"", ""oppenheim's dystonia"", ""cramp"", ""appendicular dystonias"", ""movement disorders"", ""patients"", ""focal dystonia"", ""dystonia"", ""cervical dystonia""]"

TOR1A-associated arthrogryposis multiplex congenita 5 (AMC5) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder arising from biallelic variants in TOR1A, a gene that in the heterozygous state is associated with torsion dystonia-1 (DYT1 or DYT-TOR1A), an early-onset dystonia with reduced penetrance. While 15 individuals with AMC5-TOR1A have been reported (less than 10 in detail), a systematic investigation of the full disease-associated spectrum has not been conducted. Here, we assess the clinical, radiological and molecular characteristics of 57 individuals from 40 families with biallelic variants in TOR1A. Median age at last follow-up was 3 years (0-24 years). Most individuals presented with severe congenital flexion contractures (95%) and variable developmental delay (79%). Motor symptoms were reported in 79% and included lower limb spasticity and pyramidal signs, as well as gait disturbances. Facial dysmorphism was an integral part of the phenotype, with key features being a broad/full nasal tip, narrowing of the forehead and full cheeks. Analysis of disease-associated manifestations delineated a phenotypic spectrum ranging from normal cognition and mild gait disturbance to congenital arthrogryposis, global developmental delay, intellectual disability, absent speech and inability to walk. In a subset, the presentation was consistent with foetal akinesia deformation sequence with severe intrauterine abnormalities. Survival was 71%, with higher mortality in males. Death occurred at a median age of 1.2 months (1 week-9 years), due to respiratory failure, cardiac arrest or sepsis. Analysis of brain MRI studies identified non-specific neuroimaging features, including a hypoplastic corpus callosum (72%), foci of signal abnormality in the subcortical and periventricular white matter (55%), diffuse white matter volume loss (45%), mega cisterna magna (36%) and arachnoid cysts (27%). The molecular spectrum included 22 distinct variants, defining a mutational hotspot in the C-terminal domain of the Torsin-1A protein. Genotype-phenotype analysis revealed an association of missense variants in the 3-helix bundle domain to an attenuated phenotype, while missense variants near the Walker A/B motif as well as biallelic truncating variants were linked to early death. In summary, this systematic cross-sectional analysis of a large cohort of individuals with biallelic TOR1A variants across a wide age-range delineates the clinical and genetic spectrum of TOR1A-related autosomal-recessive disease and highlights potential predictors for disease severity and survival.""","""2023""","[""tor1a"", ""autosomal-recessive disease"", ""death"", ""torsin-1a"", ""c"", ""arachnoid cysts"", ""white matter volume loss"", ""hypoplastic corpus callosum"", ""sepsis"", ""cardiac arrest"", ""respiratory failure"", ""mortality"", ""akinesia deformation"", ""inability"", ""congenital arthrogryposis"", ""facial dysmorphism"", ""lower limb spasticity"", ""congenital flexion contractures"", ""dystonia"", ""dyt1"", ""torsion dystonia-1"", ""neurodevelopmental disorder"", ""arthrogryposis multiplex congenita"", ""neurodegeneration"", ""neurodevelopmental disorders"", ""autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative diseases""]"

PET scans from 267 children with dystonia being evaluated for possible Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) surgery between September 2007 and February 2018 at Evelina London Children's Hospital (ELCH) United Kingdom were examined. Scans without gross anatomical abnormality (e.g. large cysts, significant ventriculomegaly; n = 240) were analysed with Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM12). Glucose metabolism patterns were examined in the 144/240 (60%) cases with the ten commonest childhood-onset dystonias, focusing on nine anatomical regions. A group of thirty-nine adult controls was used for comparisons. The genetic dystonias were associated with the following genes: TOR1A, THAP1, SGCE, KMT2B, HPRT1 (Lesch Nyhan disease), PANK2 and GCDH (Glutaric Aciduria type 1). The acquired Cerebral Palsy (CP) cases were divided into those related to prematurity (CP-Preterm), neonatal jaundice/kernicterus (CP-Kernicterus) and hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (CP-Term). Each dystonia subgroup had distinct patterns of altered FDG-PET uptake. Focal glucose hypometabolism of the pallidi, putamina, or both, was the commonest finding, except in PANK2, where basal ganglia metabolism appeared normal. HPRT1 uniquely showed glucose hypometabolism across all nine cerebral regions. Temporal lobe glucose hypometabolism was found in KMT2B, HPRT1 and CP-Kernicterus. Frontal lobe hypometabolism was found in SGCE, HPRT1, and PANK2. Thalamic and brainstem hypometabolism were seen only in HPRT1, CP-Preterm and CP-term dystonia cases. The combination of frontal and parietal lobe hypermetabolism was uniquely found in CP-term cases.

The aim of this study was to identify TOR1A Exon 5 mutations in a large cohort of subjects with mainly non-generalized primary dystonia.<h4>Methods</h4>High resolution melting (HRM) was used to examine the entire TOR1A Exon 5 coding sequence in 1014 subjects with primary dystonia (422 spasmodic dysphonia, 285 cervical dystonia, 67 blepharospasm, 41 writer's cramp, 16 oromandibular dystonia, 38 other primary focal dystonia, 112 segmental dystonia, 16 multifocal dystonia, and 17 generalized dystonia) and 250 controls (150 neurologically normal and 100 with other movement disorders).

Twelve forms are inherited as autosomal dominant, four as autosomal recessive and one as an X-linked recessive trait. Three additional autosomal dominant forms (DYT9, DYT19 and DYT20) might exist based on linkage mapping to regions apparently different from, yet in close proximity to or overlapping with the known loci DYT18, DYT10 and DYT8. Clinically, this group of movement disorders includes pure dystonias and dystonia plus syndromes. In addition, dyskinesias (paroxysmal dystonias), although phenotypically distinct from classical dystonias, are discussed within this group. In pure dystonias, dystonia is occasionally accompanied by tremor. In dystonia plus syndromes, dystonia as the prominent sign concurs with other movement abnormalities such as myoclonus and parkinsonism. In the dyskinesias, dystonia occurs as a paroxysmal sign in association with other movement anomalies and sometimes seizures. While gross neuropathological changes are absent in most primary dystonias, including the paroxysmal forms, striking morphological alterations are found in some, such as in the X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism syndrome (DYT3). Neuropathological findings at the microscopic level have also been reported in several cases of dystonia 1 and 5, both of which were previously thought to be morphologically normal. One locus, DYT14 had been erroneously assigned, by linkage mapping, in a family with dystonia 5. There are two forms of dystonia 5, one autosomal dominant and one autosomal recessive. These forms are designated here as dystonia 5a and dystonia 5b (DYT5a, DYT5b), respectively.

"""20301665""","""DYT1 Early-Onset Isolated Dystonia""","""<h4>Clinical characteristics</h4>DYT1 early-onset isolated dystonia typically presents in childhood or adolescence and only on occasion in adulthood. Dystonic muscle contractions causing posturing or irregular tremor of a leg or arm are the most common presenting findings. Dystonia is usually first apparent with specific actions such as writing or walking. Over time, the contractions frequently (but not invariably) become evident with less specific actions and spread to other body regions. No other neurologic abnormalities are present. Disease severity varies considerably even within the same family. Isolated writer's cramp may be the only sign.<h4>Diagnosis/testing</h4>The diagnosis of DYT1 dystonia is established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous TOR1A pathogenic variant on molecular genetic testing. A TOR1A three base-pair deletion, c.907_909delGAG, is identified in most affected individuals.<h4>Management</h4>Treatment of manifestations: Oral medications, either alone or in combination, are usually tried first, including anticholinergics, baclofen, benzodiazepines, and others. Botulinum toxin injections for treatment of focal symptoms can be used in conjunction with oral medications. If oral medications and botulinum toxin injections do not provide sufficient control of symptoms, surgery enabling deep-brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus interna (GPi) should be considered. Prevention of secondary complications: Aggressive medical and surgical intervention to prevent contractures of the joints and deformities of the spine. Surveillance: Follow up with a neurologist specializing in movement disorders several times a year. Agents/circumstances to avoid: The extremities affected by dystonia should not be placed in a brace or cast, unless medically necessary, as this can worsen the dystonia.<h4>Genetic counseling</h4>DYT1 dystonia is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner with reduced penetrance. Offspring of an affected individual or of an asymptomatic individual known to have a TOR1A pathogenic variant have a 50% chance of inheriting the variant and if inherited a 30% chance of developing clinical findings.

"""24092288""","""Dystonia.""","""<h4>Purpose of review</h4>The purpose of this review is to provide an update on the classification, phenomenology, pathophysiology, and treatment of dystonia.<h4>Recent findings</h4>A revised definition based on the main phenomenologic features of dystonia has recently been developed in an expert consensus approach. Classification is based on two main axes: clinical features and etiology. Currently, genes have been reported for 14 types of monogenic isolated and combined dystonia. Isolated dystonia (with dystonic tremor) can be caused by mutations in TOR1A (DYT1), TUBB4 (DYT4), THAP1 (DYT6), PRKRA (DYT16), CIZ1 (DYT23), ANO3 (DYT24), and GNAL (DYT25). Combined dystonias (with parkinsonism or myoclonus) are further subdivided into persistent (GCHI [DYT5], SGCE [DYT11], and ATP1A3 [DYT12], with TAF1 most likely but not yet proven to be linked to DYT3) and paroxysmal (PNKD [DYT8], PRRT2 [DYT10], and SLC2A1 [DYT18]). Recent insights from neurophysiologic studies identified functional abnormalities in two networks in dystonia: the basal ganglia-sensorimotor network and, more recently, the cerebellothalamocortical pathway. Besides the well-known lack of inhibition at different CNS levels, dystonia is specifically characterized by maladaptive plasticity in the sensorimotor cortex and loss of cortical surround inhibition. The exact role (modulatory or compensatory) of the cerebellar-cortical pathways still has to be further elucidated. In addition to botulinum toxin for focal forms, deep brain stimulation of the globus pallidus internus is increasingly recognized as an effective treatment for generalized and segmental dystonia.<h4>Summary</h4>The revised classification and identification of new genes for different forms of dystonia, including adult-onset segmental dystonia, enable an improved diagnostic approach. Recent pathophysiologic insights have fundamentally contributed to a better understanding of the disease mechanisms and impact on treatment, such as functional neurosurgery and nonpharmacologic treatment options.""","""2013""","[""pnkd"", ""segmental dystonia"", ""ganglia-sensorimotor"", ""functional abnormalities"", ""dyt18"", ""slc2a1"", ""dyt10"", ""prrt2"", ""dyt8"", ""dystonia"", ""dystonic tremor"", ""tor1a"", ""dyt1"", ""tubb4"", ""dyt4"", ""thap1"", ""dyt6"", ""prkra"", ""dyt16"", ""ciz1"", ""dyt23"", ""ano3"", ""dyt24"", ""gnal"", ""dyt25"", ""combined dystonias"", ""parkinsonism"", ""myoclonus"", ""dyt5"", ""sgce"", ""dyt11"", ""atp1a3"", ""dyt12"", ""taf1"", ""dyt3""]"

The classification of dystonia has developed along with increasing knowledge, and different schemes have been suggested, including age at onset, body distribution, and etiology as the main differentiating factors. A revised definition and a new classification of dystonia have now been proposed by a group of leading dystonia experts and will be referred here. The discovery of the first two gene mutations causing primary generalized dystonia (DYT1-TOR1A and DYT6-THAP1) has facilitated studies on pathogenesis and pathophysiology of primary dystonias, by comparing neurophysiology between manifesting and non-manifesting carriers, and by studying the molecular biology of the mutant gene products. During recent years, several other gene mutations causing primary dystonia, dystonia-plus, and paroxysmal dystonia disorders have been discovered. Only during the last year, by the use of whole-exome sequencing techniques, mutations in three different genes in families with predominantly cervical dystonia were found, which may lead to improved insight into the pathogenesis also of the more frequent focal dystonias. Botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) and deep brain stimulation (DBS) have revolutionized the symptomatic treatment for dystonia during the last two decades and continue to be refined to improve efficacy and expand their indications. Unfortunately, no progress has been made in the oral medication of dystonia.

While inclusion formation is a characteristic feature for ΔE TOR1A, elevated levels of aggregates for other mutations were not observed when compared with WT TOR1A. WT and mutant TOR1A showed preferred degradation through the autophagy-lysosome pathway, which is most pronounced for p.A14_P15del, p.R288Q, and ΔE TOR1A. Notably, blocking of the autophagy pathway with bafilomycin resulted in a significant increase in inclusion formation in p.E121K TOR1A. In addition, all variants had an influence on protein stability. Although the p.A14_P15del mutation affects the proposed oligomerization domain of TOR1A, this mutation did not disturb the ability to dimerize.

Although autosomal-dominant mutations in TOR1A, THAP1, and GNAL have been found in some cases, the molecular mechanisms underlying isolated dystonia are largely unknown. In addition, although emphasis has been placed on dominant isolated dystonia, the disorder is also transmitted as a recessive trait, for which no mutations have been defined. Using whole-exome sequencing in a recessive isolated dystonia-affected kindred, we identified disease-segregating compound heterozygous mutations in COL6A3, a collagen VI gene associated previously with muscular dystrophy. Genetic screening of a further 367 isolated dystonia subjects revealed two additional recessive pedigrees harboring compound heterozygous mutations in COL6A3. Strikingly, all affected individuals had at least one pathogenic allele in exon 41, including an exon-skipping mutation that induced an in-frame deletion. We tested the hypothesis that disruption of this exon is pathognomonic for isolated dystonia by inducing a series of in-frame deletions in zebrafish embryos. Consistent with our human genetics data, suppression of the exon 41 ortholog caused deficits in axonal outgrowth, whereas suppression of other exons phenocopied collagen deposition mutants. All recessive mutation carriers demonstrated early-onset segmental isolated dystonia without muscular disease. Finally, we show that Col6a3 is expressed in neurons, with relevant mRNA levels detectable throughout the adult mouse brain. Taken together, our data indicate that loss-of-function mutations affecting a specific region of COL6A3 cause recessive isolated dystonia with underlying neurodevelopmental deficits and highlight the brain extracellular matrix as a contributor to dystonia pathogenesis.""","""2015""","[""dystonia"", "" the disorder"", ""neurodevelopmental deficits"", ""mouse"", ""col6a3"", ""muscular disease"", ""segmental isolated dystonia"", ""human"", ""zebrafish"", ""isolated dystonia"", ""muscular dystrophy"", ""tor1a"", ""thap1"", ""gnal""]"

For the latter, numerous genetic associations studies have been performed with largely inconsistent results. The aim of this study was to perform a field synopsis including systematic meta-analyses of genetic association studies in isolated dystonia.<h4>Methods</h4>For the field synopsis we systematically screened and scrutinized the published literature using NCBI's PubMed database. For genetic variants with sufficient information in at least two independent datasets, random-effects meta-analyses were performed, including meta-analyses stratified by ethnic descent and dystonia subtypes.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 3575 articles were identified and scrutinized resulting in the inclusion of 42 independent publications allowing 134 meta-analyses on 45 variants across 17 genes. While our meta-analyses pinpointed several association signals with variants in TOR1A, DRD1, and ARSG, no single variant displayed compelling association with dystonia in the available data.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our study provides an up-to-date summary of the status of dystonia genetic association studies.

In this study, we used an engineered Cas9 variant from Streptococcus pyogenes (SpCas9-VRQR) to target the mutation in the TOR1A gene in order to disrupt mutant torsinA in DYT1 patient fibroblasts. Selective targeting of the DYT1 allele was highly efficient with most common non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) edits, leading to a predicted premature stop codon with loss of the torsinA C terminus (delta 302-332 aa). Structural analysis predicted a functionally inactive status of this truncated torsinA due to the loss of residues associated with ATPase activity and binding to LULL1. Immunoblotting showed a reduction of the torsinA protein level in Cas9-edited DYT1 fibroblasts, and a functional assay using HSV infection indicated a phenotypic recovery toward that observed in control fibroblasts.

Patients with psychogenic (n = 6) or organic (n = 5, DYT1 gene mutation positive) dystonia of the right leg, and matched healthy control subjects (n = 6) underwent positron emission tomography of regional cerebral blood flow. Participants were studied during rest, during fixed posturing of the right leg and during paced ankle movements. Continuous surface electromyography and footplate manometry monitored task performance. Averaging regional cerebral blood flow across all tasks, the organic dystonia group showed abnormal increases in the primary motor cortex and thalamus compared with controls, with decreases in the cerebellum. In contrast, the psychogenic dystonia group showed the opposite pattern, with abnormally increased blood flow in the cerebellum and basal ganglia, with decreases in the primary motor cortex. Comparing organic dystonia with psychogenic dystonia revealed significantly greater regional blood flow in the primary motor cortex, whereas psychogenic dystonia was associated with significantly greater blood flow in the cerebellum and basal ganglia (all P < 0.05, family-wise whole-brain corrected). Group × task interactions were also examined. During movement, compared with rest, there was abnormal activation in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex that was common to both organic and psychogenic dystonia groups (compared with control subjects, P < 0.05, family-wise small-volume correction). These data show a cortical-subcortical differentiation between organic and psychogenic dystonia in terms of regional blood flow, both at rest and during active motor tasks. The pathological prefrontal cortical activation was confirmed in, but was not specific to, psychogenic dystonia. This suggests that psychogenic and organic dystonia have different cortical and subcortical pathophysiology, while a derangement in mechanisms of motor attention may be a feature of both conditions.""","""2013""","[""organic dystonia"", ""participants"", ""dyt1"", ""patients"", ""neurological disorders"", ""dystonia"", ""psychogenic dystonia"", ""psychogenic movement disorders"", ""psychogenic versus organic dystonia""]"

Here, we explore the hypothesis that deficits in torsinA function result in an increased vulnerability to stress associated with protein folding and processing in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where torsinA is located. Using an in vivo quantitative readout for the ER stress response, we evaluated the consequences of torsinA mutations in transgenic nematodes expressing variants of human torsinA. This analysis revealed that, normally, torsinA serves a protective function to maintain a homeostatic threshold against ER stress. Furthermore, we show that the buffering capacity of torsinA is greatly diminished by the DYT1-associated deletion or mutations that prevent its translocation to the ER, block ATPase activity, or increase the levels of torsinA in the nuclear envelope versus ER. Combinations of transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans designed to mimic clinically relevant genetic modifiers of disease susceptibility also exhibit a direct functional correlation to changes in the ER stress response. Furthermore, using mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from torsinA knockout mice, we demonstrated that loss of endogenous torsinA results in enhanced sensitivity to ER stress.

Assessment should be performed using a validated rating scale for dystonia. Genetic testing may be performed after establishing the clinical diagnosis. DYT1 testing is recommended for patients with primary dystonia with limb onset before age 30, and in those with an affected relative with early-onset dystonia. DYT6 testing is recommended in early-onset or familial cases with cranio-cervical dystonia or after exclusion of DYT1. Individuals with early-onset myoclonus should be tested for mutations in the DYT11 gene. If direct sequencing of the DYT11 gene is negative, additional gene dosage is required to improve the proportion of mutations detected. A levodopa trial is warranted in every patient with early-onset primary dystonia without an alternative diagnosis. In patients with idiopathic dystonia, neurophysiological tests can help with describing the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the disorder.<h4>Treatment</h4>botulinum toxin (BoNT) type A is the first-line treatment for primary cranial (excluding oromandibular) or cervical dystonia; it is also effective on writing dystonia. BoNT/B is not inferior to BoNT/A in cervical dystonia.

In the current study, we investigate this history, assuming the perspective of a spectrum from organic to psychogenic, between which ideas were moving. We have focussed on (i) primary generalized dystonia, (ii) cervical dystonia, (iii) writer's cramp and (iv) fixed dystonia related to complex regional pain syndrome. We have studied medical texts published since the 19th century and their references. Jean-Martin Charcot advocated the concept of hysteria, disorders in which, besides predisposition, environmental factors were involved in their pathogenesis. Sigmund Freud introduced psychoanalysis as an explanatory therapy for psychic disorders. Previous theories, together with the lack of an organic substrate for dystonia, made a strong case for psychogenic explanations. Consequently, many dystonia patients were told that they suffered from psychological conflicts and were treated for them. However, after the description of new hereditary cases in the 1950s, the limited efficacy of psychotherapy in torsion dystonia, the effects of surgical treatments and the lesion studies in the 1960s, more physicians became convinced of the organic nature. The culminating point was the discovery of the DYT1 gene in 1997. In the meantime, experts had already convinced the neurological community that cervical dystonia and writer's cramp were focal dystonias, i.e. minor forms of generalized dystonia, and therefore organic disorders. In contrast, the pathophysiology of fixed dystonia related to complex regional pain syndrome remained controversial. Knowledge of this history, which played on the border between neurology and psychiatry, is instructive and reflects the difficulty in discriminating between them. Today, new insights from functional imaging and neurophysiological studies again challenge the interpretation of these disorders, while the border between psychogenic and organic has become more blurred. Abnormalities of sensorimotor integration and cortical excitability that are currently supposed to be the underlying cause of dystonia bring us back to Sherringtonian physiology.

Using immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, we first established that the related transmembrane proteins LULL1 and LAP1 are prominent binding partners for torsinA in U2OS cells. Comparative analysis demonstrates that these two proteins are targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum or nuclear envelope by their divergent N-terminal domains. Binding of torsinA to their C-terminal lumenal domains is stabilized when residues in any one of three motifs implicated in ATP hydrolysis (Walker B, sensor 1, and sensor 2) are mutated. Importantly, the DeltaGAG deletion does not stabilize this binding. Indeed, deleting the DeltaGAG encoded glutamic acid residue from any of the three ATP hydrolysis mutants destabilizes their association with LULL1 and LAP1C, suggesting a possible basis for loss of torsinA function.

This association with human nesprin-3 appeared to be stronger for torsinADeltaE than for torsinA. TorsinA also associated with the KASH domains of nesprin-1 and -2 (SYNE1 and 2), which link to actin. In the absence of torsinA, in knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), nesprin-3alpha was localized predominantly in the ER. Enrichment of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-nesprin-3 in the ER was also seen in the fibroblasts of DYT1 patients, with formation of YFP-positive globular structures enriched in torsinA, vimentin and actin. TorsinA-null MEFs had normal NE structure, but nuclear polarization and cell migration were delayed in a wound-healing assay, as compared with wild-type MEFs. These studies support a role for torsinA in dynamic interactions between the KASH domains of nesprins and their protein partners in the lumen of the NE, with torsinA influencing the localization of nesprins and associated cytoskeletal elements and affecting their role in nuclear and cell movement.""","""2008""","[""torsina"", ""patients"", ""mouse"", ""syne1 and 2"", ""nesprin-1 and -2"", ""human"", ""plectin"", ""vimentin"", ""nesprin-3"", ""dyt1"", ""torsion dystonia"", ""movement disorder""]"

In recent years, 15 genes associated with dystonia have been identified and classified as DYT loci. Of these, DYT1 is the most frequent, causing early-onset generalized dystonia. Pathophysiology remains ill understood but basal ganglia dysfunction is thought to play an important role. Treatment remains symptom-oriented. A trial of levodopa is recommended in young-onset cases.

While the aberrant deposition of FG-Nups is caused by defective nuclear pore complex assembly, the source of K48-ubiquitylated proteins inside NE blebs is not known. Here, we demonstrate that the characteristic K48-ubiquitin accumulation inside blebs requires p97 activity. This activity is highly dependent on the p97 adaptor UBXD1. We show that p97 does not significantly depend on the Ufd1/Npl4 heterodimer to generate the K48-ubiquitylated proteins inside blebs, nor does inhibiting translation affect the ubiquitin sequestration in blebs. However, stimulating global ubiquitylation by heat shock greatly increases the amount of K48-ubiquitin sequestered inside blebs.

These results initially suggested that DeltaE-torsin A might exist as insoluble aggregates. However, both torsin A and DeltaE-torsin A were readily solubilized by nonionic detergents, were similarly accessible to proteases, and displayed equivalent migration patterns on sucrose gradients. Collectively, these data support that both the wild type and torsion dystonia-associated forms of torsin A are properly folded, lumenal proteins of similar oligomeric states.

Others, including a single nucleotide polymorphism that replaces aspartic acid (D) at residue 216 with histidine (H) in 12% of normal alleles and two other rare deletions, have not been clearly associated with disease. To gain insight into how these sequence variations affect torsinA, we used the structure of the related protein ClpB to provide a model of torsinA's AAA+ domain. Motifs important for ATP hydrolysis-sensor 1 and sensor 2-were identified, mutagenized and used to validate predictions of this model. Inspection revealed that the DeltaGAG deletion associated with dystonia removes one residue from an alpha-helix in the C-terminal portion of the AAA+ domain. The resulting distortion in torsinA structure may underlie this mutant's known tendency to produce ER-derived inclusions as well as its proposed loss of function. The D/H polymorphism at residue 216 falls in the N-terminal portion of the AAA+ domain near the sensor 1 motif. Surprisingly, cells expressing torsinA with the polymorphic histidine developed inclusions similar to those associated with DeltaGAG-torsinA, indicating that this change may also affect torsinA structure.

At least 13 different genes and gene loci have been reported. While a 3-bp deletion in the DYT1 gene is the most frequent cause of early limb-onset, generalized dystonia, it has also been found in non-generalized forms of sporadic dystonia. An 18-bp deletion in the DYT1 gene has also been reported.<h4>Objectives</h4>We screened for the 3-bp and 18-bp deletions in the DYT1 gene among our sporadic, adult-onset primary dystonia patients in Singapore. We reviewed the literature to compare the frequency of DYT1 mutation between the East and the West.<h4>Methods</h4>We screened 54 patients with primary dystonia (focal: n=41; segmental: n=11; multifocal: n=1; generalized: n=1) for the deletions in the DYT1 gene. A careful review of all published literature on DYT1 screening among sporadic, non-familial, non-Ashkenazi Jewish patients was done.<h4>Results</h4>We did not detect any mutations in the exon 5 of the DYT1 gene in any of our patients.

A US study estimated the prevalence at approximately 1 in 30,000. The estimated prevalence in the general population of Europe seems to be lower, ranging from 1 in 330,000 to 1 in 200,000, although precise numbers are currently not available. The estimated prevalence in the Ashkenazi Jewish population is approximately five to ten times higher, due to a founder mutation. Symptoms of EOTD typically develop first in an arm or leg in middle to late childhood and progress in approximately 30% of patients to other body regions (generalized dystonia) within about five years. Distribution and severity of symptoms vary widely between affected individuals. The majority of cases from various ethnic groups are caused by an autosomal dominantly inherited deletion of 3 bp (GAG) in the DYT1 gene on chromosome 9q34. This gene encodes a protein named torsinA, which is presumed to act as a chaperone protein associated with the endoplasmic reticulum and the nuclear envelope. It may interact with the dopamine transporter and participate in intracellular trafficking, although its precise function within the cell remains to be determined. Molecular genetic diagnostic and genetic counseling is recommended for individuals with age of onset below 26 years, and may also be considered in those with onset after 26 years having a relative with typical early onset dystonia. Treatment options include botulinum toxin injections for focal symptoms, pharmacological therapy such as anticholinergics (most commonly trihexiphenydil) for generalized dystonia and surgical approaches such as deep brain stimulation of the internal globus pallidus or intrathecal baclofen application in severe cases.

At P14, prominent expression of torsinA was noted in both striatal cholinergic interneurons and cerebellar Purkinje cells.

This autosomal dominant neurologic disorder is characterized by abnormal movements, believed to originate from neuronal dysfunction in the basal ganglia of the human brain. The torsins (torsinA and torsinB) are members of the \""ATPases associated with a variety of cellular activities\"" (AAA(+)) superfamily of proteins that mediate chaperone and other functions involved in conformational modeling of proteins, protection from stress, and targeting of proteins to cellular organelles. In this study, the intracellular localization and levels of endogenous torsin were evaluated in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells following differentiation and stress. TorsinA, apparent MW 37 kDa, cofractionates with markers for the microsomal/endoplasmic reticulum (ER) compartment and appears to reside primarily within the ER lumen based on protease resistance. TorsinA immunoreactivity colocalizes with the lumenal ER protein protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) and extends throughout neurites. Levels of torsinA did not increase notably in response to nerve growth factor-induced differentiation. None of the stress conditions tested, including heat shock and the unfolded protein response, affected torsinA, except for oxidative stress, which resulted in an increase in the apparent MW of torsinA and redistribution to protrusions from the cell surface. These findings are consistent with a relatively rapid covalent modification of torsinA in response to oxidative stress causing a change in state.

Two neurologists reviewed the videotaped examination and rated the severity and constancy of dystonia, calculating a total dystonia score for each patient.<h4>Results</h4>Prevalence of dystonia of any severity was 95.2%. Twenty-four of 42 (57.1%) had dystonia in at least one body region that was moderate and present more than half of the time, and seven of 42 (16.7%) had dystonia that was severe and constant. The most prevalent types of dystonia were internal shoulder rotation (64.3%), sustained fist clenching (47.1%), excessive knee flexion (42.9%), and foot inversion (42.9%). In 37 of 42 (88.1%) patients, there were more than two types of dystonia, and in the average patient, three to four types of dystonia. The mean severity was between 1 (mild) and 2 (moderate), and the mean constancy was between 2 (present less than half of the time) and 3 (present more than half of the time). Multivariate linear regression revealed that disease duration (p = 0.0005) and taking an antidopaminergic agent (p = 0.03) were positively associated with the total dystonia score.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The majority of patients in this HD clinic exhibited some dystonia.

This type of dystonia following perinatal injury has been termed \""delayed onset dystonia due to static encephalopathy of childhood\"". According to the definition of dystonia, we were able to select 5 patients with the aetiologic diagnosis of perinatal asphyxia from the group of 347 out- and inpatients (1.4%) treated for various types of dystonia at the Movement Disorders Department (Institute of Neurology, CCS, Belgrade) from November 1986 to November 1994. At onset of dystonia the mean age of patients was 13.2 years (range from 10 to 17), with combined initial involvement of the arm and neck in 3 patients. The period from the onset of the disease to the maximum severity lasted 8.2 years (range from 4 to 14), resulting in segmental brachial dystonia in 3, hemidystonia and generalized dystonia in one patient each (Table 1). The adverse perinatal events are described in Table 2. Three of our patients had delayed achievements of developmental milestones. All patients were regularly schooled and had preserved intellectual capacities, except the patient 3 whose achievements were below average (IQ = 86). Different drugs were administered (Table 3), but moderate effects were achieved only with trihexyphenidyl in two patients (daily doses of 24 mg and 30 mg, respectively), and baclofen (80 mg p.d.) in one patient. In this study we describe 5 new patients who fulfilled the criteria for the diagnosis of delayed-onset dystonia due to perinatal asphyxia (Tables 1 and 2). We accepted the approach of Saint-Hilaire et al. to suggest a relationship between perinatal asphyxia and later occurrence of dystonia in our 5 patients. However, coincident occurrence of a primary dystonia with a static encephalopathy of childhood due to perinatal asphyxia cannot be excluded. This phenomenon of delayed appearance of dystonia was also described in other forms of static cerebral injury; i.e. stroke, head trauma or anoxic brain damage. Interestingly enough, age at the time of anoxia or brain insults seemed to be crucial for the development of dystonia: those who suffer acute brain insults during childhood or early life are more likely to develop dystonia than the older patients. Therefore, the \""static\"" nature of encephalopathy induced by perinatal asphyxia is questionable. Finally, this study strengthens the suggestion that perinatal asphyxia can lead to delayed-onset dystonia, and, since \""some of these patients closely resemble cases of idiopathic torsion dystonia, the prior occurrence of asphyxia should be used as a criterion of exclusion for that diagnosis\"".""","""1997""","[""idiopathic torsion dystonia"", ""anoxia"", ""head trauma or anoxic brain damage"", ""static cerebral injury"", ""baclofen"", ""trihexyphenidyl"", ""achievements of developmental milestones"", ""patient"", ""hemidystonia"", ""brachial dystonia"", ""movement disorders"", ""patients"", ""encephalopathy"", ""neurological deficit"", ""asphyxia"", ""head trauma"", ""stroke"", ""brain injuries"", ""dystonia""]"

The authors used statistical parametric mapping to compare glucose metabolism between patients with EB and control subjects in each condition.

With movement suppression during sleep, the EB group exhibited superior-medial frontal hypometabolism in a region associated with cortical control of eyelid movement. Network analysis demonstrated a specific metabolic covariance pattern associated with ITD was also expressed in the patients with EB in both the sleep and wake conditions.<h4>Conclusion</h4>These findings suggest that the clinical manifestations of EB are associated with abnormal metabolic activity in the pons and cerebellum, whereas the functional substrate of the disorder may be associated with abnormalities in cortical eyelid control regions.

Similar to the pattern in humans, this effect could be attenuated by coadministration of diphenhydramine. Unilateral microinjection of histamine itself into the rat red nucleus produced dystonic postures (torticollis) in a dose-dependent manner, demonstrating that a histamine dysfunction could contribute to the pathophysiology of dystonia. The torticollis produced by histamine could be significantly attenuated with coadministration of the H1 antagonists diphenhydramine or pyrilamine or the H2 antagonist cimetidine. These effects are thought to be mediated through the red nucleus because significantly more torticollis was observed when histamine was injected into the red nucleus rather than surrounding mid-brain areas, the substantia nigra, or the lateral ventricle.

Substance P, a member of the tachykinin family of neuropeptides, is a major component in the direct pathway from striatum to basal ganglia output nuclei. In the present study quantitative autoradiography was used to examine changes in neurokinin-1 (NK-1) and neurokinin-3 (NK-3) receptors in mutant dystonic hamsters (dt(sz)), a well characterized model of paroxysmal dystonia. NK-1 receptors were labeled in 10 dystonic brains and 10 age-matched controls with 3 nM [(3)H]-[Sar(9), Met(O(2))(11)]-SP. NK-3 binding sites were labeled in adjacent sections with 2.5 nM [(3)H]senktide. NK-1 binding was found to be unaltered in 27 brain areas examined. In contrast, NK-3 binding was significantly reduced in layers 4 and 5 of the prefrontal (-46%), anterior cingulate (-42%) and parietal (-45%) cortices, ventromedial thalamus (-42%) and substantia nigra pars compacta (-36%) in dystonic brains compared to controls. The latter effects may be particularly relevant in view of evidence that activation of NK-3 receptors on dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta can increase nigrostriatal dopaminergic activity. Since previous studies indicated that a reduced basal ganglia output in mutant hamsters is based on an overactivity of the direct pathway which also innervates substantia nigra pars compacta neurons, the decreased NK-3 binding could be related to a receptor down-regulation. The present finding of decreased NK-3 receptor density in the substantia nigra pars compacta, thalamic and cortical areas substantiates the hypothesis that disturbances of the basal ganglia-thalamus-cortex circuit play a critical role in the pathogenesis of paroxysmal dystonia.""","""2002""","[""sar"", ""dystonic brains"", ""paroxysmal dystonia"", ""dystonic"", ""primary dystonias"", ""hamster""]"

Primary dystonia includes syndromes in which dystonia is the sole phenotypic manifestation with the exception that tremor can be present as well. Primary dystonias are typically mobile and may show task specificity. Fixed dystonias are often psychogenic or associated with complex regional pain syndrome. Fixed dystonia may also be the terminal consequence of long-standing, inadequately-treated, severe appendicular or cervical dystonia. The vast majority of primary dystonias have their onset in adults. Late-onset, primary, focal dystonia, particularly blepharospasm, may spread to affect other anatomical segments. Patients with focal dystonia may also exhibit spontaneous remissions that last for years. Although sensory tricks are commonly reported by patients with primary dystonia, they have also been described in subjects with secondary dystonia. Another important sensory aspect of dystonia is pain which is relatively common in cervical dystonia but also reported by many patients with masticatory dystonia, hand-forearm dystonia and blepharospasm.

Selective targeting of the DYT1 allele was highly efficient with most common non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) edits, leading to a predicted premature stop codon with loss of the torsinA C terminus (delta 302-332 aa). Structural analysis predicted a functionally inactive status of this truncated torsinA due to the loss of residues associated with ATPase activity and binding to LULL1. Immunoblotting showed a reduction of the torsinA protein level in Cas9-edited DYT1 fibroblasts, and a functional assay using HSV infection indicated a phenotypic recovery toward that observed in control fibroblasts.

Previous reports have suggested that torsin 1A, a protein mutated in this disease, might function as a chaperone that prevents the toxic aggregation of misfolded polypeptides. The aim of the study: The aim of this study was to verify the chaperone function of torsin 1A by investigating its ability to prevent the aggregation of huntingtin model peptides.<h4>Patients and methods</h4>Materials and methods: N-terminal mutant huntingtin fragments of different length were co-expressed in neuronal HT-22 and non-neuronal HeLa cells with either the wild-type or mutant (ΔE302/303) torsin 1A protein. The transfected cells were immunostained and analyzed for the presence of huntingtin aggregates using fluorescence microscopy.<h4>Results</h4>Results: The immunofluorescence analysis of huntingtin subcellular distribution within the transfected cells showed no significant difference between the huntingtin aggregation levels in cells co-expressing the wild-type torsin 1A and in control cells co-transfected with an empty vector. Instead, it was the increased level of huntingtin aggregation in the presence of the torsion dystonia-causing ΔE302/303 mutant that reached statistical significance in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Conclusions: Either torsin 1A does not function as a chaperone protein or huntingtin is not an efficient substrate for such a hypothetical chaperone activity. However, the ability of mutant torsin 1A to stimulate the accumulation of aggregation-prone polypeptides might constitute an important source of ΔE302/303 pathogenicity and thus a potential target for future therapy.""","""2018""","[""torsin 1a"", ""chaperone proteins"", ""torsion dystonia"", ""tor1a"", ""huntingtin"", ""protein aggregation""]"
"""20301665""","""DYT1 Early-Onset Isolated Dystonia""","""<h4>Clinical characteristics</h4>DYT1 early-onset isolated dystonia typically presents in childhood or adolescence and only on occasion in adulthood. Dystonic muscle contractions causing posturing or irregular tremor of a leg or arm are the most common presenting findings. Dystonia is usually first apparent with specific actions such as writing or walking. Over time, the contractions frequently (but not invariably) become evident with less specific actions and spread to other body regions. No other neurologic abnormalities are present. Disease severity varies considerably even within the same family. Isolated writer's cramp may be the only sign.<h4>Diagnosis/testing</h4>The diagnosis of DYT1 dystonia is established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous TOR1A pathogenic variant on molecular genetic testing. A TOR1A three base-pair deletion, c.907_909delGAG, is identified in most affected individuals.<h4>Management</h4>Treatment of manifestations: Oral medications, either alone or in combination, are usually tried first, including anticholinergics, baclofen, benzodiazepines, and others. Botulinum toxin injections for treatment of focal symptoms can be used in conjunction with oral medications. If oral medications and botulinum toxin injections do not provide sufficient control of symptoms, surgery enabling deep-brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus interna (GPi) should be considered. Prevention of secondary complications: Aggressive medical and surgical intervention to prevent contractures of the joints and deformities of the spine. Surveillance: Follow up with a neurologist specializing in movement disorders several times a year. Agents/circumstances to avoid: The extremities affected by dystonia should not be placed in a brace or cast, unless medically necessary, as this can worsen the dystonia.<h4>Genetic counseling</h4>DYT1 dystonia is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner with reduced penetrance. Offspring of an affected individual or of an asymptomatic individual known to have a TOR1A pathogenic variant have a 50% chance of inheriting the variant and if inherited a 30% chance of developing clinical findings. Once the TOR1A c.907_909delGAG deletion has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing for DYT1 dystonia are possible.""","""2016""","[""dyt1 early-onset isolated dystonia"", ""oppenheim's dystonia"", ""torsin-1a"", ""early-onset torsion dystonia"", ""tor1a""]"

Functional alterations of the basal ganglia circuits have been implicated in this disease. Striatal dopamine receptor 2 (D2R) levels are significantly decreased in DYT1 dystonia patients and in the animal models of DYT1 dystonia. D2R-expressing cells, such as the medium spiny neurons in the indirect pathway, striatal cholinergic interneurons, and dopaminergic neurons in the basal ganglia circuits, contribute to motor performance. However, the function of torsinA in these neurons and its contribution to the motor symptoms is not clear. Here, D2R-expressing-cell-specific Dyt1 conditional knockout (d2KO) mice were generated and in vivo effects of torsinA loss in the corresponding cells were examined. The Dyt1 d2KO mice showed significant reductions of striatal torsinA, acetylcholine metabolic enzymes, Tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA), and cholinergic interneurons. The Dyt1 d2KO mice also showed significant reductions of striatal D2R dimers and tyrosine hydroxylase without significant alteration in striatal monoamine contents or the number of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. The Dyt1 d2KO male mice showed motor deficits in the accelerated rotarod and beam-walking tests without overt dystonic symptoms. Moreover, the Dyt1 d2KO male mice showed significant correlations between striatal monoamines and locomotion.

Tor1a conditional knockout in the striatum or cerebral cortex leads to motor deficits, suggesting the importance of corticostriatal connection in the pathogenesis of dystonia. Indeed, corticostriatal long-term depression impairment has been demonstrated in multiple targeted DYT1 mouse models. Pappas and colleagues developed a conditional knockout line (Dlx-CKO) that inactivated Tor1a in the forebrain and surprisingly displayed overt dystonia.

At 8 months, retesting revealed motor deficits in rotarod, beam walking, grip strength, and hyperactivity in the open field; however, no overt dystonia was visually discernible or through the machine learning-based video analysis.

While animal models provide insights into disease mechanisms, significant species-dependent differences exist since animals with the identical heterozygous mutation fail to show pathology. Here, we model DYT1 by using human patient-specific cholinergic motor neurons (MNs) that are generated through either direct conversion of patients' skin fibroblasts or differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). These human MNs with the heterozygous <i>TOR1A</i> mutation show reduced neurite length and branches, markedly thickened nuclear lamina, disrupted nuclear morphology, and impaired nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT) of mRNAs and proteins, whereas they lack the perinuclear \""blebs\"" that are often observed in animal models. Furthermore, we uncover that the nuclear lamina protein LMNB1 is upregulated in DYT1 cells and exhibits abnormal subcellular distribution in a cholinergic MNs-specific manner. Such dysregulation of LMNB1 can be recapitulated by either ectopic expression of the mutant <i>TOR1A</i> gene or shRNA-mediated downregulation of endogenous <i>TOR1A</i> in healthy control MNs. Interestingly, downregulation of LMNB1 can largely ameliorate all the cellular defects in DYT1 MNs.

In addition, an extensive literature search to identify original articles (published before 10 August 2020) reporting mutations in TOR1A, THAP1 or GNAL associated to dystonia was performed.<h4>Results</h4>Pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in TOR1A, THAP1 and GNAL were identified in 0.48%, 0.57% and 0.29% of our patients, respectively. Five patients carried the variation p.Glu303del in TOR1A. A very rare variant in GNAL (p.Ser238Asn) was found as a putative risk factor for dystonia. In the literature, variations in TOR1A, THAP1 and GNAL accounted for about 6%, 1.8% and 1.1% of published dystonia patients, respectively.<h4>Conclusions</h4>There is a different genetic contribution to dystonia of these three genes in our patients (about 1.3% of patients) and in the literature (about 3.6% of patients), probably due the high proportion of adult-onset cases in our cohort. As regards age at onset, site of dystonia onset, and final distribution, in our population there is a clear differentiation between DYT-TOR1A and DYT-GNAL, with DYT-THAP1 likely to be an intermediate phenotype.""","""2020""","[""isolated dystonia"", ""thap1"", ""tor1a"", ""mutational study"", ""literature review"", ""gnal""]"

It followed MDSGene's standardized data extraction protocol and screened a total of ~1200 citations. Phenotypic and genotypic data on ~1200 patients with 254 different mutations were curated and analyzed. There were differences regarding age at onset, site of onset, and distribution of symptoms across mutation carriers in all 7 genes. Although carriers of TOR1A, THAP1, PRKRA, KMT2B, or HPCA mutations mostly showed childhood and adolescent onset, patients with GNAL and ANO3 mutations often developed first symptoms in adulthood. GNAL and KMT2B mutation carriers frequently have 1 predominant site of onset, that is, the neck (GNAL) or the lower limbs (KMT2B), whereas site of onset in DYT-TOR1A, DYT-THAP1, DYT-ANO3, DYT-PRKRA, and DYT-HPCA was broader. However, in most DYT-THAP1 and DYT-ANO3 patients, dystonia first manifested in the upper half of the body (upper limb, neck, and craniofacial/laryngeal), whereas onset in DYT-TOR1A, DYT-PRKRA and DYT-HPCA was frequently observed in an extremity, including both upper and lower ones. For ANO3, a segmental/multifocal distribution was typical, whereas TOR1A, PRKRA, KMT2B, and HPCA mutation carriers commonly developed generalized dystonia. THAP1 mutation carriers presented with focal, segmental/multifocal, or generalized dystonia in almost equal proportions. GNAL mutation carriers rarely showed generalization.

Autosomal dominant torsion dystonia-1 is a disease with incomplete penetrance most often caused by an in-frame GAG deletion (p.Glu303del) in the endoplasmic reticulum luminal protein torsinA encoded by TOR1A. We report an association of the homozygous dominant disease-causing TOR1A p.Glu303del mutation, and a novel homozygous missense variant (p.Gly318Ser) with a severe arthrogryposis phenotype with developmental delay, strabismus and tremor in three unrelated Iranian families. All parents who were carriers of the TOR1A variant showed no evidence of neurological symptoms or signs, indicating decreased penetrance similar to families with autosomal dominant torsion dystonia-1. The results from cell assays demonstrate that the p.Gly318Ser substitution causes a redistribution of torsinA from the endoplasmic reticulum to the nuclear envelope, similar to the hallmark of the p.Glu303del mutation. Our study highlights that TOR1A mutations should be considered in patients with severe arthrogryposis and further expands the phenotypic spectrum associated with TOR1A mutations.""","""2017""","[""tor1a"", ""endoplasmic reticulum luminal protein torsina"", ""severe arthrogryposis"", ""tor1a p.glu303del"", ""dyt1 dystonia""]"

Symptoms typically appear during childhood, suggesting the presence of an early critical period of sensorimotor circuit susceptibility to torsinA dysfunction. Here, we identified in two different DYT1 mouse strains, heterozygous torsinA knockout mice (Tor1a+/-) and human ΔGAG mutant torsinA transgenic mice (hMT), the anatomical abnormalities in the cerebellum, during a critical age for synaptogenesis (postnatal day 14, P14). By means of immunofluorescence, confocal analysis and western blot quantification, we observed a reduced inhibitory input on Purkinje cells (PCs) as well as an unbalanced excitatory innervation; a significant reduction of the parallel fiber (PF) synaptic terminals and an increase of the climbing fiber (CF) inputs. Finally, in support of the in vivo results, we also provide evidence of an impaired PF synaptogenesis in a co-culture system. Of note, these alterations were rescued and in part over-compensated in the adult age in both mouse strains, suggesting that torsinA dysfunction can induce an altered maturation of cerebellar synaptic contacts. Altogether these results indicate that a loss of function of torsinA during cerebellar synaptogenesis induces important developmental alterations, that might contribute to the age-dependent susceptibility to develop dystonia in mutation carriers.""","""2015""","[""development"", ""cerebellum"", ""synaptogenesis"", ""purkinje cells"", ""glutamatergic synapse"", ""gabaergic synapse"", ""dyt1 dystonia"", ""δgag mutant torsina""]"

Wild-type (Tor1a<sup>+/+</sup>, N=10) and mutant (Tor1a<sup>+/-</sup>, N=10) mice from post-natal day P25 to P35 were randomly distributed to experimental and control groups. Patch-clamp and current-clamp recordings of SPNs were conducted with intracellular electrodes for electrophysiological analyses. Striatal changes of the direct and indirect pathways were investigated via immunofluorescence. Golgi-Cox staining was conducted to observe spine morphology of SPNs. To quantify postsynaptic signaling proteins in striatum, RNA-Seq, qRT-PCR and WB were performed in striatal tissues.<h4>Results</h4>Long-term depression (LTD) was failed to be induced, while long-term potentiation (LTP) was further strengthened in striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs) from the Tor1a<sup>+/-</sup> DYT1 dystonia mice. Spine morphology analyses revealed a significant increase of both number of mushroom type spines and spine width in Tor1a<sup>+/-</sup> SPNs.

Mutations predicted to compromise specific torsinA functional motifs showed a synthetic interaction with the ΔE mutation and destabilized torsinAΔE, suggesting that the ΔE mutation predisposes torsinA to defects in the presence of secondary insults. In this case, BiP was required for torsinAΔE degradation, consistent with data that specific chaperones exhibit either pro-degradative or pro-folding activities.

Patients and controls all came from Southwest China.<h4>Results</h4>The following two common variants were found in the 3'-UTR of TOR1A: NM_000113.2:c.*414delG (rs35153737) and NM_000113.2:c.*824delG (rs3842225). The rs35153737 variant showed a statistically significant association with dystonia using the allele model (P=0.035) and the dominant genetic model (P=0.018); however, no association between rs3842225 and dystonia was found.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our study suggests that there is an association between rs35153737 and dystonia in a southwestern Chinese population, and it may be caused by high linkage disequilibrium between this deletion and potential pathogenic variants in TOR1A.""","""2017""","[""southwestern chinese"", ""dyt1"", ""dystonia"", ""mutation""]"

Nuclear envelope (NE) blebs that contain FG-nucleoporins (FG-Nups) and K48-linked ubiquitin are the hallmark phenotype of Torsin manipulation across disease models of DYT1 dystonia. While the aberrant deposition of FG-Nups is caused by defective nuclear pore complex assembly, the source of K48-ubiquitylated proteins inside NE blebs is not known. Here, we demonstrate that the characteristic K48-ubiquitin accumulation inside blebs requires p97 activity. This activity is highly dependent on the p97 adaptor UBXD1. We show that p97 does not significantly depend on the Ufd1/Npl4 heterodimer to generate the K48-ubiquitylated proteins inside blebs, nor does inhibiting translation affect the ubiquitin sequestration in blebs. However, stimulating global ubiquitylation by heat shock greatly increases the amount of K48-ubiquitin sequestered inside blebs. These results suggest that blebs have an extraordinarily high capacity for sequestering ubiquitylated protein generated in a p97-dependent manner. The p97/UBXD1 axis is thus a major factor contributing to cellular DYT1 dystonia pathology and its modulation represents an unexplored potential for therapeutic development.""","""2022""","[""ubiquitin"", ""erad"", ""dystonia"", ""p97"", ""dyt1"", ""torsina"", ""yod1"", ""ubxd1"", ""ufd1/npl4""]"

Dystonia is often accompanied by pain, and neuropathic pain can be associated to peripherally induced movement disorder and dystonia. However, no evidence exists on the effect of gabapentin in mice subjected to neuropathic pain model overexpressing human normal or mutated TA.<h4>Methods</h4>Mice subjected to L5 spinal nerve ligation (SNL) develop mechanical allodynia and upregulation of the α2δ-1 L-type calcium channel subunit, forming a validated experimental model of neuropathic pain. Under these experimental conditions, TA is expressed in dorsal horn neurons and astrocytes and colocalizes with α2δ-1. Similar to this subunit, TA is overexpressed in dorsal horn 7 days after SNL. This model has been used to investigate (1) basal mechanical sensitivity; (2) neuropathic pain phases; and (3) the effect of gabapentin, an α2δ-1 ligand used against neuropathic pain, in non-transgenic (NT) C57BL/6 mice and in mice overexpressing human wild-type (hWT) or mutant (hMT) TA.<h4>Results</h4>In comparison to non-transgenic mice, the threshold for mechanical sensitivity in hWT or hMT does not differ (Kruskal-Wallis test = 1.478; <i>p</i> = 0.4777, although, in the latter animals, neuropathic pain recovery phase is delayed. Interestingly, gabapentin (100 mg/Kg) reduces allodynia at its peak (occurring between post-operative day 7 and day 10) but not in the phase of recovery.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These data lend support to the investigation on the role of TA in the molecular machinery engaged during neuropathic pain.""","""2021""","[""dyt1"", ""torsin a."", ""snl"", ""transgenic mice"", ""gabapentin"", ""neuropathic pain""]"

DYT1 dystonia is one of the most common genetic dystonias, and most patients carry heterozygous DYT1 ∆GAG mutations causing a loss of a glutamic acid of the protein torsinA. Patients can be treated with anticholinergics, such as trihexyphenidyl, suggesting an abnormal cholinergic state. Early work on the cell-autonomous effects of Dyt1 deletion with ChI-specific Dyt1 conditional knockout mice (Dyt1 Ch1KO) revealed abnormal electrophysiological responses of striatal ChIs to muscarine and quinpirole, motor deficits, and no changes in the number or size of the ChIs. However, the Chat-cre line that was used to derive Dyt1 Ch1KO mice contained a neomycin cassette and was reported to have ectopic cre-mediated recombination. In this study, we generated a Dyt1 Ch2KO mouse line by removing the neomycin cassette in Dyt1 Ch1KO mice. The Dyt1 Ch2KO mice showed abnormal paw clenching behavior, motor coordination and balance deficits, impaired motor learning, reduced striatal choline acetyltransferase protein level, and a reduced number of striatal ChIs. Furthermore, the mutant striatal ChIs had a normal muscarinic inhibitory function, impaired quinpirole-mediated inhibition, and altered current density.

Although the mechanisms underlying the dystonic movements are largely unknown, abnormalities in striatal dopamine and acetylcholine neurotransmission are consistently implicated whereby dopamine release is reduced while cholinergic tone is increased. Because striatal cholinergic neurotransmission mediates dopamine release, it is not known if the dopamine release deficit is mediated indirectly by abnormal acetylcholine neurotransmission or if Tor1a(ΔE) acts directly within dopaminergic neurons to attenuate release. To dissect the microcircuit that governs the deficit in dopamine release, we conditionally expressed Tor1a(ΔE) in either dopamine neurons or cholinergic interneurons in mice and assessed striatal dopamine release using ex vivo fast scan cyclic voltammetry or dopamine efflux using in vivo microdialysis. Conditional expression of Tor1a(ΔE) in cholinergic neurons did not affect striatal dopamine release. In contrast, conditional expression of Tor1a(ΔE) in dopamine neurons reduced dopamine release to 50% of normal, which is comparable to the deficit in Tor1a<sup>+/ΔE</sup> knockin mice that express the mutation ubiquitously. Despite the deficit in dopamine release, we found that the Tor1a(ΔE) mutation does not cause obvious nerve terminal dysfunction as other presynaptic mechanisms, including electrical excitability, vesicle recycling/refilling, Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, D2 dopamine autoreceptor function and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor function, are intact.

In the cerebellar vermis, VAChT expression was also significantly decreased in patients versus controls, but independently of age.

Among the few therapeutic options, broad-spectrum antimuscarinic drugs are utilized, aimed at counteracting abnormal striatal acetylcholine-mediated transmission, which plays a crucial role in dystonia pathophysiology. We previously demonstrated a complete loss of long-term synaptic depression (LTD) at corticostriatal synapses in rodent models of two distinct forms of isolated dystonia, resulting from mutations in the TOR1A (DYT1), and GNAL (DYT25) genes. In addition to anticholinergic agents, the aberrant excitability of striatal cholinergic cells can be modulated by group I metabotropic glutamate receptor subtypes (mGlu1 and 5). Here, we tested the efficacy of the negative allosteric modulator (NAM) of metabotropic glutamate 5 (mGlu) receptor, dipraglurant (ADX48621) on striatal LTD. We show that, whereas acute treatment failed to rescue LTD, chronic dipraglurant rescued this form of synaptic plasticity both in DYT1 mice and GNAL rats. Our analysis of the pharmacokinetic profile of dipraglurant revealed a relatively short half-life, which led us to uncover a peculiar time-course of recovery based on the timing from last dipraglurant injection. Indeed, striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs) recorded within 2 h from last administration showed full expression of synaptic plasticity, whilst the extent of recovery progressively diminished when SPNs were recorded 4-6 h after treatment. Our findings suggest that distinct dystonia genes may share common signaling pathway dysfunction.

We found that D2KO mice showed greater impairment than Ch2KO mice, including reduced sensory-evoked brain activity in key regions of the sensorimotor network, and altered functional connectivity of the striatum that correlated with motor deficits.

Dystonia has traditionally been considered a disorder of the basal ganglia. However, growing evidence suggests that the cerebellum may be involved in certain types of dystonia, raising several questions. Can different types of dystonia be classified as either a basal ganglia disorder or a cerebellar disorder? Is dystonia a network disorder that involves the cerebellum and basal ganglia? If dystonia is a network disorder, how can we target treatments to alleviate symptoms in patients? A recent study by Chen et al, using the pharmacological mouse model of rapid-onset dystonia parkinsonism, has provided some insight into these important questions. They showed that the cerebellum can directly modulate basal ganglia activity through a short latency cerebello-thalamo-basal ganglia pathway. Further, this article and others have provided evidence that in some cases, aberrant cerebello-basal ganglia communication can be involved in dystonia. In this review we examine the evidence for the involvement of the cerebellum and cerebello-basal ganglia interactions in dystonia. We conclude that there is ample evidence to suggest that the cerebellum plays a role in some dystonias, including the early-onset primary torsion dystonia DYT1 and that further studies examining the role of this brain region and its interaction with the basal ganglia in dystonia are warranted. © 2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.""","""2017""","[""dystonia"", ""basal ganglia"", ""cerebellum"", ""dyt1"", ""rapid onset dystonia parkinsonism"", ""movement disorders""]"
