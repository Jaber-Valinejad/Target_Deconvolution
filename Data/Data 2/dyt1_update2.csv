"""2317008""","""Dystonia gene in Ashkenazi Jewish population is located on chromosome 9q32-34.""","""Idiopathic torsion dystonia (ITD) is a neurological disorder characterized by sustained muscle contractions that appear as twisting movements of the limbs, trunk, and/or neck, which can progress to abnormal postures. Most familial forms of ITD follow autosomal dominant transmission with reduced penetrance. The frequency of ITD in the Ashkenazi Jewish population is five to ten times greater than that in other groups. Recently, a gene for ITD (DYT1) in a non-Jewish kindred was located on chromosome 9q32-34, with tight linkage to the gene encoding gelsolin (GSN). In the present study linkage analysis using DNA polymorphisms is used to locate a gene responsible for susceptibility to ITD in 12 Ashkenazi Jewish families. This dystonia gene exhibits close linkage with the gene encoding argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS), and appears by multipoint analysis to lie in the q32-34 region of chromosome 9, a region that also contains the loci for gelsolin and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase. The same gene may be responsible for ITD both in the non-Jewish kindred mentioned above and in the Ashkenazi Jewish families presented here. However, because there is substantial difference between the penetrance of the dominant allele in these two groups, two different mutations may be operating to produce susceptibility to this disease in the two groups.""","""1990""","[""dystonia"", ""ass"", ""argininosuccinate synthetase"", ""gelsolin"", ""gsn"", ""dyt1"", ""neurological disorder"", ""dopamine-beta-hydroxylase"", ""idiopathic torsion dystonia""]"

It has been suggested that inheritance may differ in Jews and non-Jews. In the present study, data gathered in a nationwide survey of ITD in Israel were analysed. Between 1969 and 1980, 47 patients were collected, of whom 40 were of European origin. In these European Jews, the ITD frequency was about 1:23 000 live births, which was five-fold greater than in Jews of Afro-Asian origin. Assuming that all cases fit the same genetic model, an X linked or a simple autosomal recessive model of inheritance did not agree well with our data. An autosomal dominant model with low penetrance could have accounted for our observations and would yield an ITD gene frequency in European Jews of 3 to 4:100 000. In view of the increased ages of their fathers, the isolated cases may have included some new mutations. Multifactorial inheritance was also possible.

Results are consistent with linkage to the DYT1 region. Affected individuals in these families are clinically similar to the AJ cases; i.e., the site of onset is predominantly in the limbs and at least one individual in each pedigree had onset before age 12 years. None carries the AJ haplotype; therefore, they probably represent different mutations in the DYT1 gene. The two French Canadian families, however, display the same haplotype. Estimates of penetrance in non-Jewish families range from .40 to .75. We identified disease gene carriers and, with adjustments for age at onset, obtained a direct estimate of penetrance of .46.

The remaining nine to 11 patients with generalized childhood dystonia are thought, because of a probable paternal age effect, to be examples of new dominant mutations.

Using (GT)n and RFLP markers in this region, we have identified obligate recombination events in some of these Jewish families, which further delineate the area containing the DYT1 gene to a 6-cM region bounded by loci AK1 and ASS. In 52 unrelated, affected Ashkenazi Jewish individuals, we have found highly significant linkage disequilibrium between a particular extended haplotype at the ABL-ASS loci and the DYT1 gene. The 4/A12 haplotype for ABL-ASS is present on 69% of the disease-bearing chromosomes among affected Jewish individuals and on only 1% of control Jewish chromosomes (chi 2 = 91.07, P much less than .001). The allelic association between this extended haplotype and DYT1 predicts that these three genes lie within 1-2 cM of each other; on the basis of obligate recombination events, the DYT1 gene is centromeric to ASS. Furthermore, this allelic association supports the idea that a single mutation event is responsible for most hereditary cases of dystonia in the Jewish population. Of the 53 definitely affected typed, 13 appear to be sporadic, with no family history of dystonia. However, the proportion of sporadic cases which potentially carry the A12 haplotype at ASS (8/13 [62%]) is similar to the proportion of familial cases with A12 (28/40 [70%]). This suggests that many sporadic cases are hereditary, that the disease gene frequency is greater than 1/15,000, and that the penetrance is lower than 30%, as previously estimated in this population. Most affected individuals were heterozygous for the ABL-ASS haplotype, a finding supporting autosomal dominant inheritance of the DYT1 gene. The ABL-ASS extended-haplotype status will provide predictive value for carrier status in Jewish individuals.

We studied a genetically homogeneous group of 41 subjects with the 460InsA mutation in FTL1, documenting the presentation, clinical course, biochemistry and neuroimaging.

The majority reported a family history of a movement disorder often misdiagnosed as Huntington's disease. The disease progressed relentlessly, becoming generalized over a 5-10 year period, eventually leading to aphonia, dysphagia and severe motor disability with subcortical/frontal cognitive dysfunction as a late feature. A characteristic action-specific facial dystonia was common (65%), and in 63% there was asymmetry throughout the disease course. Serum ferritin levels were low in the majority of males and post-menopausal females, but within normal limits for pre-menopausal females. MR brain imaging was abnormal on all affected individuals and one presymptomatic carrier. In conclusion, isolated parkinsonism is unusual in neuroferritinopathy, and unlike Huntington's disease, cognitive changes are absent or subtle in the early stages.

These involuntary movements when occur in the childhood show the specific ages of onset and the courses. For example postural dystonia occurs in childhood but action dystonia tend to occur in later ages. Postural tremor occurs after the second decades but resting tremor does not occur in childhood. Furthermore drug induced dystonia but not levodopa induced dyskinesia occurs in childhood. The age dependent clinical features observed in these involuntary movements are thought to be due to the specific developmental processes of the pathway in the basal ganglia and its efferent projections, which are involved in the pathophysiology in the each disorder. For example, the dopamine activity is known to be increased in the striatum before ten years of age which decreases, rapidly during the first decade and further decreases in the next decade with the moderate degree till adult level. The direct pathway, which is predominant in the ventral area in the basal ganglia, matures earlier than the indirect pathway, which is predominant in the dorsal area.

The study objectives were to investigate the frequency of the human leukocyte antigen system (HLA) for CD in pediatric T1DM patients and to determine whether HLA testing is suitable for CD screening in that population and is cost-effective as compared to serological screening for CD.<h4>Patients and methods</h4>A retrospective, descriptive study was conducted in 296 patients (148 girls; 148 boys) with T1DM aged <18 years who attended a Madrid hospital. Data on the frequency of genotypes DQ2/DQ8 in a subgroup of 92 patients and the additional cost of performing HLA typing for screening CD were collected. Only when the risk HLA haplotype (DQ2/DQ8) is negative no further serological screening for CD is required.<h4>Results</h4>Twenty-three patients with T1DM (7.77%) also had CD. Alleles DQ2 or DQ8 were found in 91.3% of patients in whom the HLA haplotype was studied. Thus, only 8.7% with a negative haplotype would have benefited from HLA testing. The additional cost of HLA typing was € 105.2 for each patient with positive DQ2 or DQ8 in our population.<h4>Conclusions</h4>HLA typing is not a cost-effective screening method for CD in T1DM because of the frequent association of T1DM with risk genotypes for CD.""","""2021""","[""human"", ""patients"", ""patient"", ""infant"", ""mammalian"", ""infants"", ""boy"", ""child"", ""woman"", ""humans"", ""children"", ""girl"", ""mammal"", ""boys"", ""participants"", ""women"", ""man"", ""donor"", ""persons"", ""men"", ""person"", ""people"", ""girls"", ""peoples"", ""participant"", ""outpatient"", ""donor variant"", ""patient variant"", ""mammalians"", ""homo sapiens"", ""pt"", ""homo sapiens linnaeus, 1758"", ""pts"", ""h. sapiens"", ""humans. subsp"", ""human pv"", ""hs"", ""mans"", ""patients. variant"", ""patients. str"", ""pats"", ""patients' variant"", ""mammalia"", ""children. pv"", ""p=ns"", ""human variant"", ""pns"", ""ch"", ""hsa"", ""patients, bv"", ""op"", ""child."", ""patients, pv"", ""patients."", ""patients,"", ""patients. pv"", ""para"", ""patients; str"", ""p = ns"", ""p =ns"", ""pten"", ""human bv"", ""ppl"", ""patients (variant"", ""humans, variant"", ""hu"", ""patients (pv"", ""patients pv"", ""humans, bv"", ""human biovar"", ""ptts"", ""pat"", ""patients (bv"", ""women. bv"", ""women. pv"", ""donor pv"", ""patient, variant"", ""human subspecies"", ""d+/r"", ""patients). pv"", ""patients; variant"", ""patient pv"", ""p"", ""patients), str"", ""pn"", ""diabetes mellitus"", ""celiac disease"", ""dq2""]"

The variation in genetic risk association is likely linked to different HLA class II loci susceptibility, but association studies of HLA class I alleles are scarce. The aim was to investigate HLA class I A, B, and C alleles polymorphisms in children with only T1D, CD, and a subgroup with both T1D and CD (T1D w/CD).<h4>Materials and methods</h4>HLA class I A, B, and C genes were genotyped using next-generation targeted sequencing. A conditional analysis was performed on 68 children with T1D, 219 children with CD and seven children with T1D w/CD enrolled from a birth cohort study at high genetic risk children from the South of Sweden.<h4>Results</h4>Among 1764 HLA class I allele variants, A*29:02:01 in T1D w/CD was associated with both T1D (OR = 21.42 [1.05, 1322.4], p = 0.0231) and CD (OR = 35 [2.36, 529.12], p = 0.0051) along with C*05:01:01 with both T1D (OR = 5.54 [1.06, 24.8], p = 0.02) and CD (OR = 6.84 [1.46, 26.01], p = 0.0077). No independent effects of HLA-B allele associations were observed in T1D w/CD.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Although the distribution of HLA class I alleles differs between children with T1D and CD, the A*29:02:01 and C*05:01:01 alleles showed shared risk association of both diseases.""","""2021""","[""human"", ""patients"", ""patient"", ""infant"", ""mammalian"", ""infants"", ""boy"", ""child"", ""woman"", ""humans"", ""children"", ""girl"", ""mammal"", ""boys"", ""participants"", ""women"", ""man"", ""donor"", ""persons"", ""men"", ""person"", ""people"", ""girls"", ""peoples"", ""participant"", ""outpatient"", ""donor variant"", ""patient variant"", ""mammalians"", ""homo sapiens"", ""pt"", ""homo sapiens linnaeus, 1758"", ""pts"", ""h. sapiens"", ""humans. subsp"", ""human pv"", ""hs"", ""mans"", ""patients. variant"", ""patients. str"", ""pats"", ""patients' variant"", ""mammalia"", ""children. pv"", ""p=ns"", ""human variant"", ""pns"", ""ch"", ""hsa"", ""patients, bv"", ""op"", ""child."", ""patients, pv"", ""patients."", ""patients,"", ""patients. pv"", ""para"", ""patients; str"", ""p = ns"", ""p =ns"", ""pten"", ""human bv"", ""ppl"", ""patients (variant"", ""humans, variant"", ""hu"", ""patients (pv"", ""patients pv"", ""humans, bv"", ""human biovar"", ""ptts"", ""pat"", ""patients (bv"", ""women. bv"", ""women. pv"", ""donor pv"", ""patient, variant"", ""human subspecies"", ""d+/r"", ""patients). pv"", ""patients; variant"", ""patient pv"", ""p"", ""patients), str"", ""pn"", ""celiac disease"", ""diabetes"", ""dq2"", ""hla-b""]"

Class I and II major histocompatibility locus (MHC) antigen typing was performed on 60 patients (26 chronic bullous disease of childhood, 34 adult linear IgA disease), and the findings were correlated with the clinical course. The typing was performed using a lymphocyte microcytotoxicity assay, and the results were compared with a reference population of U.K. organ donors. Analysis of the tumour necrosis factor (TNF) locus was performed using sequence-specific oligonucleotides on a dot blot in 51 patients and compared with a random control population and human lymphocyte antigen (HLA) DR3 matched controls. The disease was found to be significantly associated with HLA Cw7 (chi2 = 19.24, P = 0.001), B8 (chi2 = 9.89, P = 0.04) and DR3 (chi2 = 10.47, P = 0.014), all components of the common Caucasian haplotype. There was also a close association between the disease and possession of HLA DR2 or 3 (chi2 = 16.34, P = 0.001). A reduction in the incidence of DR1 and DR4 (alleles carrying the rheumatoid motif) was observed, which is more marked in the children (chi2 = 8.34, P = 0.039). In the childhood group there was an increased frequency of B8, DR3 and DQ2 compared with the adults which included five of 26 who were homozygous for these antigens, a feature not seen in the adults, which may account for the differences seen between the two groups. Possession of HLA B8, DR3 and DQ2 probably facilitates earlier presentation of the disease as there is no evidence from our results that the adults and children differ fundamentally in their MHC associations. The rare TNF2 allele was found in 29 of 51 patients (expected 8.2, chi2 = 18. 3, P = 0.0001). This was more marked in the children (19 of 26).

In this study, the candidate T-cell epitopes of the La/SSB autoantigen, the main target of the autoimmune response in patients with Sjogren's Syndrome (SS), and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) were predicted using as a template the HLA-DQ2 and DQ7 molecules, which are genetically linked to patients with SS and SLE. Modeling of DQ2 and DQ7 was based on the crystal structure of HLA-DQ8, an HLA molecule of high risk factor of type I diabetes, which is also an autoimmune disease. The quality and reliability of the modeled DQ2 and DQ7 was confirmed by the Ramachandran plot and the TINKER molecular modeling software. Common and/or similar candidate T-cell epitopes, obtained by comparing three different approaches the Taylor's sequence pattern, the TEPITOPE quantitative matrices, and the MULTIPRED artificial neural network, were subjected to homology modeling with the crystal structure of the insulin-B peptide complexed with HLA-DQ8, and the best superposed candidate epitopes were placed into the modeled HLA-DQ2 and DQ7 binding grooves to perform energy minimization calculations. Six T-cell epitopes were predicted for HLA-DQ7 and nine for HLA-DQ2 covering parts of the amino-terminal and the central regions of the La/SSB autoantigen. Residues corresponding to the P1, P4, and P9 pockets of the HLA-DQ2 and DQ7 binding grooves experience very low SASA because they are less exposed to the microenvironment of the groove. The proposed T-cell epitopes complexed with HLA-DQ2/DQ7 were further evaluated for their binding efficiency according to their potential interaction energy, binding affinity, and IC50 values.

Two hundred and twenty-four patients with various causes of ataxia from North Trent (59 familial and/or positive testing for spinocerebellar ataxias 1, 2, 3, 6 and 7, and Friedreich's ataxia, 132 sporadic idiopathic and 33 clinically probable cerebellar variant of multiple system atrophy MSA-C) and 44 patients with sporadic idiopathic ataxia from The Institute of Neurology, London, were screened for the presence of antigliadin antibodies. A total of 1200 volunteers were screened as normal controls. The prevalence of antigliadin antibodies in the familial group was eight out of 59 (14%), 54 out of 132 (41%) in the sporadic idiopathic group, five out of 33 (15%) in the MSA-C group and 149 out of 1200 (12%) in the normal controls. The prevalence in the sporadic idiopathic group from London was 14 out of 44 (32%).

As few papers have investigated genetic of hypophysitis, our aim was to evaluate HLA status in a single-centre series of patients. PATIENTS AND METHOD:A retrospective, longitudinal and cross-sectional study was conducted. In consecutive Caucasian patients, clinically or histologically diagnosed for primary autoimmune hypophysitis (PAH), the HLA genotype having been determined. This cohort was compared with a control group. Anti-pituitary and anti-hypothalamus auto-antibodies evaluation was included. RESULTS:16 patients were enrolled. Fourteen patients were female (87.5%). According to HLA-DR status, we found the following: 9 of 16 patients (56.3%) haplotypes that were associated with coeliac disease (CD). Among these, 5 carried the DR7-DQ2 heterozygote haplotype (55.5%) while the remaining ones only the following haplotypes: DR3-DQ2 homozygote (25%), DR4-DQ2 heterozygote (25%), DR4-DQ8 heterozygote (50%) and DR4-DQ8 homozygote (25%), respectively. A total of 12 CD-associated haplotypes were identified. In PAH, we found a significantly higher frequency of patients carrying CD-associated HLA haplotypes as compared to the control group (respectively, 75% vs 48% P = .03; OR: 3.25 95%IC:1.1-10.3), particularly, for DQ2 and DQ8 haplotypes.

Of these, 364 were typed for human leukocyte antigen-DRB1, -DQA1, and -DQB1 genes by the polymerase chain reaction sequence specific primers method. It was suggested to the autoantibody-positive subjects that they should undergo intestinal biopsy.<h4>Results</h4>TGAA were positive in 46 of 439 relatives, EMA in 38; intestinal lesions related to CD were present in 40 subjects. We also found two immunodeficient fathers with duodenal villous atrophy. In three serology-positive subjects, permission for intestinal biopsy was refused; for another three serology-positive cases, duodenal mucosa was normal. Thus, the strict CD prevalence resulted 9.5%, the enlarged prevalence 10.9%. The DQ2/DQ8 heterodimers were carried in 231 of 364 subjects and in 38 of 40 biopsy-proven celiac patients. Three DQ2-positive parents became positive to the serology during a long-lasting follow-up.<h4>Conclusions</h4>On the basis of a carefully conducted study, CD prevalence in our series was seen as very high. These data suggest an accurate algorithm to select candidates for intestinal biopsy among CD high-risk subjects. First, an evaluation of the sensitive RIA TGAA and of total IgA (in IgA deficiency RIA IgG anti-tissue transglutaminase assay) should be performed. Then, an evaluation of the TGAA and the genetic study would be advisable 2 to 3 years later in negative subjects.

Clinical, laboratory, immunologic, and histological data were obtained from all patients.<h4>Results</h4>Clinical presentation was classical in 95% of the patients and mono-symptomatic in the remaining 5%. Anti-gliadin antibodies (AGA) and anti-transglutaminase antibodies (ATGA) were positive in 95% of the patients and negative in 5% (all with IgA deficiency). DQ2 was found in 71% of the patients (homozygotes or heterozygotes) and DQ8 was found in 9.5%. No heterodimers of risk were found in 22%.

The aim of this study was to explore the contribution of histological, serological, and genetic factors to disease presentation.<h4>Material and methods</h4>The study was designed as a retrospective chart review of 384 unrelated Caucasian patients diagnosed with CD after the age of 16 at a single UK centre.<h4>Results</h4>We found that 8.8% of IgA-competent CD patients were endomysial antibody (EMA)-negative. Compared with the EMA-positive group, EMA-negative CD patients had a lower prevalence of iron deficiency (52.0% versus 72.6%, p=0.03) and Marsh IIIb-c lesions (66.7% versus 85.3%, p=0.03). Histological severity at diagnosis correlated with anaemia (p<0.01), folate deficiency (p<0.01), and iron deficiency (p=0.05), but no other laboratory or clinical features. Compared with human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2.5-positive patients, those carrying HLA-DQ2.2 were similar in terms of all the characteristics we considered, whereas those carrying HLA-DQ8 had a lower frequency of EMA positivity (62.5% versus 92.6%, p<0.01). The proportion of EMA-positive patients increased with frequency of the HLA-DQB1*0201 allele (76.7% versus 92.3% versus 96.4% for 0 versus 1 versus 2 alleles, p<0.01); no other evidence of a gene-dose effect of HLA-DQB1*0201 was observed.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Histological severity at diagnosis of CD is associated with anaemia and some micronutrient deficiencies, but no other clinical features.

The frequency of the extended major histocompatibility complex haplotype HLA A1, B8, DR3, DQ2 (the \""8.1\"" haplotype) is increased among patients with IgAD.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>We carried out a direct measurement of the relative risk of homozygosity of the 8.1 haplotype for IgA deficiency in a population-based sample of 117 B8, DR3 homozygous individuals.<h4>Results and discussion</h4>IgA deficiency was found to be present in 2 of 117 (1.7%) of these subjects, a figure that is concordant with estimates of relative risk from large case-control studies in the Swedish population. These data are consistent with a multiplicative model for the 8.1 haplotype contribution to IgA deficiency and contrasts with prior studies, suggesting a much higher risk for 8.1 homozygosity. Using a dense single nucleotide polymorphism marker analysis of the MHC region in HLA B8, DR3, DQ2 homozygous individuals, we did not observe consistent differences between cases (n = 26) and controls (n = 24). Overall, our results do not support the hypothesis that IgA deficiency is associated with a distinct subgroup of 8.1 related haplotypes, but rather indicate that risk is conferred by the common 8.1 haplotype acting in multiplicative manner.""","""2009""","[""iga"", ""human"", ""patients"", ""patient"", ""infant"", ""mammalian"", ""infants"", ""boy"", ""child"", ""woman"", ""humans"", ""children"", ""girl"", ""mammal"", ""boys"", ""participants"", ""women"", ""man"", ""donor"", ""persons"", ""men"", ""person"", ""people"", ""girls"", ""peoples"", ""participant"", ""outpatient"", ""donor variant"", ""patient variant"", ""mammalians"", ""homo sapiens"", ""pt"", ""homo sapiens linnaeus, 1758"", ""pts"", ""h. sapiens"", ""humans. subsp"", ""human pv"", ""hs"", ""mans"", ""patients. variant"", ""patients. str"", ""pats"", ""patients' variant"", ""mammalia"", ""children. pv"", ""p=ns"", ""human variant"", ""pns"", ""ch"", ""hsa"", ""patients, bv"", ""op"", ""child."", ""patients, pv"", ""patients."", ""patients,"", ""patients. pv"", ""para"", ""patients; str"", ""p = ns"", ""p =ns"", ""pten"", ""human bv"", ""ppl"", ""patients (variant"", ""humans, variant"", ""hu"", ""patients (pv"", ""patients pv"", ""humans, bv"", ""human biovar"", ""ptts"", ""pat"", ""patients (bv"", ""women. bv"", ""women. pv"", ""donor pv"", ""patient, variant"", ""human subspecies"", ""d+/r"", ""patients). pv"", ""patients; variant"", ""patient pv"", ""p"", ""patients), str"", ""pn"", ""immunodeficiency"", ""dq2"", ""dr3"", ""iga deficiency""]"

At follow-up, the very good metabolic control on a low insulin dose and negative IA2 antibodies led to a suspicion of glucokinase (GCK)-related maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY 2). This suspicion was substantiated in multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) which showed a heterozygous GCK deletion (exons 1 to 12). However, the patient's parents did not have such a deletion and were clinically euglycemic. Given the clinical picture and the MLPA findings, array based comparative genomic hybridization was performed showing a monoallelic deletion of 7.23 Mb in the short arm of chromosome 7 (7p13-p12.1). The deleted intervals contain 39 genes listed in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man list, including GCK associated with MODY 2, CCM2 associated with type 2 cerebral cavernous malformations, IGFBP-3 associated with decrease in postnatal growth, and OGD associated with alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase deficiency, with cognitive impairment and movement abnormalities.

"""31244841""","""Dermatitis Herpetiformis: Novel Perspectives.""","""Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is an inflammatory disease of the skin, considered the specific cutaneous manifestation of celiac disease (CD). Both DH and CD occur in gluten-sensitive individuals, share the same Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) haplotypes (DQ2 and DQ8), and improve following the administration of a gluten-free diet. Moreover, almost all DH patients show typical CD alterations at the small bowel biopsy, ranging from villous atrophy to augmented presence of intraepithelial lymphocytes, as well as the generation of circulating autoantibodies against tissue transglutaminase (tTG). Clinically, DH presents with polymorphic lesions, including papules, vesicles, and small blisters, symmetrically distributed in typical anatomical sites including the extensor aspects of the limbs, the elbows, the sacral regions, and the buttocks. Intense pruritus is almost the rule. However, many atypical presentations of DH have also been reported. Moreover, recent evidence suggested that DH is changing. Firstly, some studies reported a reduced incidence of DH, probably due to early recognition of CD, so that there is not enough time for DH to develop. Moreover, data from Japanese literature highlighted the absence of intestinal involvement as well as of the typical serological markers of CD (i.e., anti-tTG antibodies) in Japanese patients with DH. Similar cases may also occur in Caucasian patients, complicating DH diagnosis. The latter relies on the combination of clinical, histopathologic, and immunopathologic findings. Detecting granular IgA deposits at the dermal-epidermal junction by direct immunofluorescence (DIF) from perilesional skin represents the most specific diagnostic tool. Further, assessing serum titers of autoantibodies against epidermal transglutaminase (eTG), the supposed autoantigen of DH, may also serve as a clue for the diagnosis. However, a study from our group has recently demonstrated that granular IgA deposits may also occur in celiac patients with non-DH inflammatory skin diseases, raising questions about the effective role of eTG IgA autoantibodies in DH and suggesting the need of revising diagnostic criteria, conceivably emphasizing clinical aspects of the disease along with DIF. DH usually responds to the gluten-free diet. Topical clobetasol ointment or dapsone may be also applied to favor rapid disease control.

HLA typing was performed to determine DQB1*02 allele dose. Patients were divided into risk groups by DQB1*02 allele dose, as follows: high-, intermediate- and low-risk groups corresponded to a double, single and zero doses, respectively.

The condition may develop at any age. Intestinal manifestations include diarrhea and weight loss. Common extraintestinal manifestations include iron deficiency anemia, decreased bone mineral density, and neuropathy. Most cases of celiac disease are diagnosed in persons with extraintestinal manifestations. The presence of dermatitis herpetiformis is pathognomonic for celiac disease. Diagnosis is supported by a positive tissue transglutaminase serologic test but, in general, should be confirmed by a small bowel biopsy showing the characteristic histology associated with celiac disease. The presence of human leukocyte antigen alleles DQ2, DQ8, or both is essential for the development of celiac disease, and can be a useful genetic test in select instances. Treatment of celiac disease is a gluten-free diet. Dietary education should focus on identifying hidden sources of gluten, planning balanced meals, reading labels, food shopping, dining out, and dining during travel. About 5% of patients with celiac disease are refractory to a gluten-free diet.

These gluten-sensitive diseases are two examples of how devastating abnormal immune responses to a ubiquitous food can be. The well-recognized risk genotype for both is conferred by either of the HLA class II molecules DQ2 or DQ8. However, only a minority of individuals who carry these molecules will develop either disease. Also of interest is that the age at diagnosis can range from infancy to 70-80 years of age. This would indicate that intolerance to gluten may potentially be the result of two different phenomena. The first would be that, for various reasons, tolerance to gluten never developed in certain individuals, but that for other individuals, prior tolerance to gluten was lost at some point after childhood. Of recent interest is the concept of non-celiac gluten sensitivity, which manifests as chronic digestive or neurologic symptoms due to gluten, but through mechanisms that remain to be elucidated.

Because of the lack of randomized therapeutic trials in DH, retrospective series and case reports have been analyzed.<h4>Results</h4>DH is related to auto-antibodies against epidermal transglutaminase, which belongs to the same family as tissue transglutaminase, the auto-antigen of celiac disease. Physiopathology is complex, occurring in HLA DQ2 or DQ8 predisposed patients, and implies gluten, immunological reaction in the intestinal wall then in the skin. DH and celiac disease may be encountered in the same family. DH is characterized by a very pruritic microvesicular eruption typically located on elbows, knees and buttocks. Digestive manifestations of celiac disease occur in 15% of cases. Direct immunofluorescence is necessary to confirm the diagnosis, showing granular IgA±C3 deposits in the papillary dermis. Circulating IgA and IgG antiendomysium and antitransglutaminase antibodies are detected in almost all patients at the acute phase and follow the clinical course of the disease. Gastro-intestinal endoscopy with multiple duodenal biopsies shows partial or complete villous atrophy in two thirds of cases, intraepithelial lymphocyte infiltrate in the other cases. Other auto-immune diseases may be associated in 10-20% of cases. The main long-term risk is the occurrence of T or B nodal or intestinal tract lymphoma in 2% of cases (relative risk close to 6 in several studies, but not admitted by all authors), especially if adherence to gluten-free diet is not strict. Treatment is based on dapsone, which is quickly efficient on cutaneous manifestations, but not on the digestive involvement and on strict and definitive gluten-free diet, which cures villous atrophy and reduces the risk of lymphoma.<h4>Conclusion</h4>DH is associated to a gluten enteropathy and its physiopathology is better known.

This affection is of immunological nature, occuring in a genetic field that predisposes to the illness (familial form: concordance of 70% in homozygote twins; 90% of patients show an HLA molecule of type DQ2, DQ8 in almost all the other cases. The exogenous factor is the gluten content contained in wheat, rye and barley, more precisely by the intermediary \""the prolamines\"" which are the \""reactive\"" element that induces a the same time an inflammatory reaction of type TH11 locally (expressed by the histological aspect of a duodenal biopsy evolving as villous atrophy) and a humoral response with production of anti-gliadine and anti-transglutaminase antibodies (the role of the latter enzyme is intervention in the local transformation of antigens to make them antigenic). It is an illness of adults as well as children and this point must now be emphasized. Recent epidemiological studies insist on a high prevalence (1/300 in Europe). Clinical expression, at the start very polymorphic and so misleading, before the appearance of the more classical signs of malabsorption and development, always feared, towards a lymphoma. These signs are haematological (anemia of various types, hyper platelets by hyposplenism, haemorrhagic signs) cutaneous (herpetiform dermatitis, cutaneous vasculitis) mucosal (aphtose), hepatic (cytolysis), neurophysical (fatigue, troubles of behaviour, cerebral syndrome, neuropathy) and osteo-articulitis (osteopenia, arthralgias, diffuse pains). The association of certain auto-immune illnesses must be emphasized (diabetes, Hashimoto thyroiditis, Gougerot disease, primitive biliary cirrhosis). To think early of the possibility of intolerance to gluten, is to give the means of a very easy diagnosis (measurement of anti-gliadin, anti-endomysium and anti-transglutaminase, and secondarily duodenal biopsy if necessary), and it is early elimination of gluten food which will make the various clinical manifestations disappear and so prevent the risk of evolution to a tumoral pathology.""","""2004""","[""coeliac disease"", ""human"", ""patients"", ""patient"", ""infant"", ""mammalian"", ""infants"", ""boy"", ""child"", ""woman"", ""humans"", ""children"", ""girl"", ""mammal"", ""boys"", ""participants"", ""women"", ""man"", ""donor"", ""persons"", ""men"", ""person"", ""people"", ""girls"", ""peoples"", ""participant"", ""outpatient"", ""donor variant"", ""patient variant"", ""mammalians"", ""homo sapiens"", ""pt"", ""homo sapiens linnaeus, 1758"", ""pts"", ""h. sapiens"", ""humans. subsp"", ""human pv"", ""hs"", ""mans"", ""patients. variant"", ""patients. str"", ""pats"", ""patients' variant"", ""mammalia"", ""children. pv"", ""p=ns"", ""human variant"", ""pns"", ""ch"", ""hsa"", ""patients, bv"", ""op"", ""child."", ""patients, pv"", ""patients."", ""patients,"", ""patients. pv"", ""para"", ""patients; str"", ""p = ns"", ""p =ns"", ""pten"", ""human bv"", ""ppl"", ""patients (variant"", ""humans, variant"", ""hu"", ""patients (pv"", ""patients pv"", ""humans, bv"", ""human biovar"", ""ptts"", ""pat"", ""patients (bv"", ""women. bv"", ""women. pv"", ""donor pv"", ""patient, variant"", ""human subspecies"", ""d+/r"", ""patients). pv"", ""patients; variant"", ""patient pv"", ""p"", ""patients), str"", ""pn"", ""enteropathy"", ""wheat"", ""triticum aestivum"", ""bread wheat"", ""wheats"", ""triticum aestivum l"", ""common wheat"", ""t. aestivum"", ""triticum aestivum, l"", ""aestivum"", ""common wheats"", ""wheat subspecies"", ""bread wheats"", ""t. aestivum l"", ""t.a"", ""triticum vulgare"", ""dq2"", ""herpetiform dermatitis"", ""cerebral syndrome"", ""gliadine"", ""prolamines"", ""barley"", ""hordeum vulgare"", ""hordeum vulgare l"", ""hordeum vulgare l. subsp"", ""h. vulgare l"", ""hv"", ""h. vulgare"", ""peripheral neuropathy""]"

Gluten sensitivity has also a skin manifestation, i.e., dermatitis herpetiformis. Both diseases have a strong genetic association with HLA DQ on chromosome 6. In this study we tried to estimate how much different clinical expressions of gluten sensitivity are determined by genetic factors, and hence how feasible they are for genetic mapping; therefore, we studied all six monozygous twin pairs found among 1292 prospectively collected patients of dermatitis herpetiformis in Finland. Three of the six twin pairs were concordant for dermatitis herpetiformis and for simultaneous enteropathy, celiac disease. Two other twin pairs were partially discordant, one of each pair had dermatitis herpetiformis and celiac disease, whereas the other had solely the gut manifestation of gluten sensitivity, i.e., celiac disease. Only one pair was found to be discordant for gluten sensitivity. All the pairs had typical risk alleles for gluten sensitivity, i.e., either HLA DQ2 or DQ8.

"""19244266""","""Hippocampal sclerosis in refractory temporal lobe epilepsy is associated with gluten sensitivity.""","""<h4>Background</h4>Previous studies have associated coeliac disease (CD) and gluten sensitivity (defined as the presence of anti-gliadin antibodies and positive immunogenetics) with cerebellar degeneration and epilepsy with occipital calcifications. Hippocampal sclerosis (HS) in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a potentially progressive disorder with unknown aetiology; however, autoimmunity has been implicated as one of the possible mechanisms leading to HS. The purpose of this study is to analyze CD-associated antibodies and gluten sensitivity in a well-characterised group of patients with refractory focal epilepsy.<h4>Methods</h4>We measured anti-gliadin, anti-tissue-transglutaminase and anti-endomysium antibodies, and coeliac-type human leukocyte antigen (DQ2 and DQ8), in 48 consecutive patients with therapy-resistant, localisation-related epilepsy. The patients were categorised into the following three groups on the basis of ictal electro-clinical characteristics and the findings of high resolution MRI: TLE with HS (n = 16), TLE without HS (n = 16) and extratemporal epilepsy (n = 16). Patients with suspected CD or gluten sensitivity underwent duodenal biopsies.<h4>Results</h4>Seven patients in total were gluten sensitive; all of these patients fell in the TLE with HS group. On the other hand, none of the TLE without HS patients or those with extratemporal epilepsy were gluten sensitive (p<0.0002). The results of duodenal biopsies showed that three of the seven gluten-sensitive patients had histological evidence of CD and four had inflammatory changes consistent with early CD without villous atrophy. Four of the patients with gluten sensitivity had evidence of dual pathology (HS+another brain lesion), whereas none of the remaining patients did (p<0.0002).<h4>Conclusions</h4>The present study demonstrates a previously unrecognised link between gluten sensitivity and TLE with HS. This association was very robust in this well-characterised group of patients; thus gluten sensitivity should be added to the list of potential mechanisms leading to intractable epilepsy and HS.""","""2009""","[""cd"", ""hippocampal sclerosis"", ""villous atrophy"", ""temporal lobe epilepsy"", ""tle"", ""epilepsy"", ""autoimmunity"", ""human"", ""patients"", ""patient"", ""infant"", ""mammalian"", ""infants"", ""boy"", ""child"", ""woman"", ""humans"", ""children"", ""girl"", ""mammal"", ""boys"", ""participants"", ""women"", ""man"", ""donor"", ""persons"", ""men"", ""person"", ""people"", ""girls"", ""peoples"", ""participant"", ""outpatient"", ""donor variant"", ""patient variant"", ""mammalians"", ""homo sapiens"", ""pt"", ""homo sapiens linnaeus, 1758"", ""pts"", ""h. sapiens"", ""humans. subsp"", ""human pv"", ""hs"", ""mans"", ""patients. variant"", ""patients. str"", ""pats"", ""patients' variant"", ""mammalia"", ""children. pv"", ""p=ns"", ""human variant"", ""pns"", ""ch"", ""hsa"", ""patients, bv"", ""op"", ""child."", ""patients, pv"", ""patients."", ""patients,"", ""patients. pv"", ""para"", ""patients; str"", ""p = ns"", ""p =ns"", ""pten"", ""human bv"", ""ppl"", ""patients (variant"", ""humans, variant"", ""hu"", ""patients (pv"", ""patients pv"", ""humans, bv"", ""human biovar"", ""ptts"", ""pat"", ""patients (bv"", ""women. bv"", ""women. pv"", ""donor pv"", ""patient, variant"", ""human subspecies"", ""d+/r"", ""patients). pv"", ""patients; variant"", ""patient pv"", ""p"", ""patients), str"", ""pn"", ""dq2"", ""occipital calcifications"", ""coeliac disease"", ""cerebellar degeneration""]"

We analyzed the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) in 32 unrelated patients and compared them to an ethnically matched sample of 137 healthy controls. Four-digit resolution HLA alleles were imputed from available Genome Wide Association data, and full HLA next-generation sequencing-based typing was also performed. HLA DQA1*05:01-DQB1*02:01-DRB1*03:01 was the most frequent class II haplotype in patients (13/32, 41%).

The genes that predispose to endocrine autoimmune diseases, e.g. type 1 diabetes, autoimmune thyroid diseases, and Addison's disease, i.e. DR3-DQ2 and DR4-DQ8, are also the major genetic determinants of CD, which is the best understood HLA-linked disease. Thus, up to 30% of first-degree relatives both of patients with CD and/or endocrine autoimmunity are affected by the other disease. In CD, certain gluten proteins bind with high affinity to HLA-DQ2 or -DQ8 in the small-intestinal mucosa, to activate gluten-specific T cells which are instrumental in the destruction of the resorptive villi. Here, the autoantigen tissue transglutaminase increases the T cell response by generating deamidated gluten peptides that bind more strongly to DQ2 or DQ8. Classical symptoms such as diarrhea and consequences of malabsorption like anemia and osteoporosis are often absent in patients with (screening-detected) CD, but this absence does not significantly affect these patients' incidence of endocrine autoimmunity. Moreover, once autoimmunity is established, a gluten-free diet is not able to induce remission. However, ongoing studies attempt to address how far a gluten-free diet may prevent or retard the development of CD and endocrine autoimmunity in children at risk.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The close relationship between CD and endocrine autoimmunity warrants a broader immune genetic and endocrine screening of CD patients and their relatives.""","""2015""","[""autoimmune thyroid diseases"", ""addison's disease"", ""osteoporosis"", ""celiac disease"", ""human"", ""patients"", ""patient"", ""infant"", ""mammalian"", ""infants"", ""boy"", ""child"", ""woman"", ""humans"", ""children"", ""girl"", ""mammal"", ""boys"", ""participants"", ""women"", ""man"", ""donor"", ""persons"", ""men"", ""person"", ""people"", ""girls"", ""peoples"", ""participant"", ""outpatient"", ""donor variant"", ""patient variant"", ""mammalians"", ""homo sapiens"", ""pt"", ""homo sapiens linnaeus, 1758"", ""pts"", ""h. sapiens"", ""humans. subsp"", ""human pv"", ""hs"", ""mans"", ""patients. variant"", ""patients. str"", ""pats"", ""patients' variant"", ""mammalia"", ""children. pv"", ""p=ns"", ""human variant"", ""pns"", ""ch"", ""hsa"", ""patients, bv"", ""op"", ""child."", ""patients, pv"", ""patients."", ""patients,"", ""patients. pv"", ""para"", ""patients; str"", ""p = ns"", ""p =ns"", ""pten"", ""human bv"", ""ppl"", ""patients (variant"", ""humans, variant"", ""hu"", ""patients (pv"", ""patients pv"", ""humans, bv"", ""human biovar"", ""ptts"", ""pat"", ""patients (bv"", ""women. bv"", ""women. pv"", ""donor pv"", ""patient, variant"", ""human subspecies"", ""d+/r"", ""patients). pv"", ""patients; variant"", ""patient pv"", ""p"", ""patients), str"", ""pn"", ""endocrine autoimmunity"", ""diabetes"", ""dq2"", ""dr4"", ""barley"", ""hordeum vulgare"", ""hordeum vulgare l"", ""hordeum vulgare l. subsp"", ""h. vulgare l"", ""hv"", ""h. vulgare"", ""cd"", ""malabsorption like anemia"", ""dr3"", ""endocrine autoimmune diseases"", ""diarrhea"", ""wheat"", ""triticum aestivum"", ""bread wheat"", ""wheats"", ""triticum aestivum l"", ""common wheat"", ""t. aestivum"", ""triticum aestivum, l"", ""aestivum"", ""common wheats"", ""wheat subspecies"", ""bread wheats"", ""t. aestivum l"", ""t.a"", ""triticum vulgare""]"

"""33239013""","""Patient factors influencing acute gluten reactions and cytokine release in treated coeliac disease.""","""<h4>Background</h4>Patients with coeliac disease (CD) commonly report a variety of adverse symptoms to gluten, but descriptions of the symptomatic response in the literature may have been confounded by the presence of food components such as fermentable carbohydrates (FODMAPs) causing symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome independent of gluten. In recent unmasked and masked low FODMAP gluten challenge studies in small groups of treated CD patients, nausea and vomiting were shown to be the key symptoms associated with serum interleukin (IL)-2 release. Our objective was to utilise a large and diverse cohort of people with CD undertaking a standardised gluten food challenge to characterise the demographic, genetic and clinical factors influencing the severity and timing of acute gluten reactions and IL-2 production.<h4>Methods</h4>A total of 295 adults treated for CD were observed for 6 h after an unmasked food challenge consisting of 10 g vital wheat gluten (low in FODMAPs) in 100 ml water. Assessments included patient-reported outcomes, serum IL-2 and adverse events. Responses were analysed according to patient characteristics, HLA-DQ genotype, duodenal histology and response to a second gluten challenge.<h4>Results</h4>Peak symptom severity was at 3 h (median severity 5/10). Peak IL-2 was at 4 h (median 4 pg/ml, range undetectable to 1028 pg/ml). Older age, older age at diagnosis, HLA-DQ2.5 positivity and homozygosity for HLA-DQB1*02 were each significantly associated with IL-2 elevations after gluten. Patients positive for HLA-DQ2.5, DQ8, DQ2.2 or DQ7 showed elevated IL-2 after gluten. Patient factors were not significantly associated with severity of digestive symptoms, but symptoms were correlated to one another and serum IL-2. Gluten challenge after 5 months caused more vomiting and higher IL-2 levels, but responses correlated with the first.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Gluten-induced symptoms and cytokine release is common in adults with treated CD. Age, genetics and previous response to gluten predict these acute reactions to gluten challenge. Structured symptom assessment and serum IL-2 after standardised gluten challenge may inform on patient diagnosis, the role of gluten in symptomatology and the need for adjunctive treatment.<h4>Trial registration</h4>ClinicalTrials.gov , NCT03644069 Registered 21 May 2018.""","""2020""","[""irritable bowel syndrome"", ""human"", ""patients"", ""patient"", ""infant"", ""mammalian"", ""infants"", ""boy"", ""child"", ""woman"", ""humans"", ""children"", ""girl"", ""mammal"", ""boys"", ""participants"", ""women"", ""man"", ""donor"", ""persons"", ""men"", ""person"", ""people"", ""girls"", ""peoples"", ""participant"", ""outpatient"", ""donor variant"", ""patient variant"", ""mammalians"", ""homo sapiens"", ""pt"", ""homo sapiens linnaeus, 1758"", ""pts"", ""h. sapiens"", ""humans. subsp"", ""human pv"", ""hs"", ""mans"", ""patients. variant"", ""patients. str"", ""pats"", ""patients' variant"", ""mammalia"", ""children. pv"", ""p=ns"", ""human variant"", ""pns"", ""ch"", ""hsa"", ""patients, bv"", ""op"", ""child."", ""patients, pv"", ""patients."", ""patients,"", ""patients. pv"", ""para"", ""patients; str"", ""p = ns"", ""p =ns"", ""pten"", ""human bv"", ""ppl"", ""patients (variant"", ""humans, variant"", ""hu"", ""patients (pv"", ""patients pv"", ""humans, bv"", ""human biovar"", ""ptts"", ""pat"", ""patients (bv"", ""women. bv"", ""women. pv"", ""donor pv"", ""patient, variant"", ""human subspecies"", ""d+/r"", ""patients). pv"", ""patients; variant"", ""patient pv"", ""p"", ""patients), str"", ""pn"", ""carbohydrates"", ""il-2"", ""hla"", ""hla-dqb1"", ""coeliac disease"", ""water"", ""water-"", ""dq2"", ""vomiting"", ""nausea""]"

The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between CVID and HLA alleles.<h4>Methods</h4>HLA class I/II alleles were analyzed in 65 patients with CVID and alleles that may be related to disease susceptibility were determined by comparing with 300 healthy controls. We also evaluated HLA allele frequencies in CVID patients with gastrointestial system (GIS) involvement and autoimmune manifestations.<h4>Results</h4>When compared with controls, frequencies of B*27, B*35, C*04, and DRB1*04 alleles were significantly different in patients with CVID (<i>p</i> < .05).

Gluten along with environmental trigger starts an inflammatory reaction which results in damage to small intestine. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQA1∗05, -DQB1∗02, and -DQB1∗03:02 are the known risk alleles of CD. The diagnostic method for CD involves serological or intestinal biopsy, but genetic test could be implemented. HLA typing precludes the need for further diagnosis and it has high negative predictive value. The aim of this study was to make aware of HLA molecular typing for celiac disease among local laboratories and healthcare professionals. The prevalence and frequency distribution of HLA-DQ2 and -DQ8 haplotypes in 175 pediatric unrelated healthy controls, celiac patients, and CD with concurrent diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1) was evaluated. The most common haplotype was DQ2 followed by DQ8. In control group only DQ2 was observed with frequency of 8.5%. In celiac patients 85.7% were DQ2, 11.4% were DQ8, and rest were DQ2/DQ8 (2.8%), and all had CD. In the group of CD with DM1, 31.4% had DQ2, 25% had DQ8, and 34% having both the haplotypes; while only 9 of these patients were suffering from CD. It was concluded that Celiac disease is frequently unrecognized by physicians, in part because of its variable clinical presentation and symptoms.

While presenting many similarities with other autoimmune diseases, celiac disease is unique in that the external trigger, gluten, and the genetic background necessary for disease development (HLA DQ2/DQ8) are well described. The prevalence of celiac disease is dramatically increasing over the years and new epidemiologic data show changes regarding age of onset and symptoms. A better understanding of CD-pathogenesis is fundamental to highlight the reasons of this rise of celiac diagnoses.<h4>Areas covered</h4>In this review we describe CD-pathogenesis by dissecting all the components necessary to lose tolerance to gluten (ingestion of gluten, genetic predisposition, loss of barrier function and immune response). Additionally, we also highlight the role that microbiome plays in celiac disease as well as new proposed therapies and experimental tools.<h4>Expert opinion</h4>Prevalence of autoimmune diseases is increasing around the world. As a result, modern society is strongly impacted by a social and economic burden. Given the unique characteristics of celiac disease, a better understanding of its pathogenesis and the factors that contribute to it may shed light on other autoimmune diseases for which external trigger and genetic background are not known.""","""2021""","[""dq2"", ""autoimmune enteropathy"", ""autoimmune diseases""]"

The global prevalence of CD is 1.4%. However, most of the prevalence studies have been conducted in Caucasian populations; few studies have been performed in Latin America. The aim of this study is to determine the seroprevalence of auto-antibodies used as markers for CD in a Colombian cohort. In this cross-sectional study, the serum samples from Colombian donors of the National Red Cross Blood Bank were collected between June and September 2017 in Bogotá, Colombia. All sera were tested for IgA antitissue transglutaminase (TTG) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Seropositive sera were tested for IgA antiendomysium (EMA) using indirect immunofluorescence assay. The ancestral genetic composition was determined in donor samples with antibody assay reactivity. Those with two seroreactive assays were typed for HLA class II DQ2 and DQ8. In total, 228 blood donors participated in the study. Among them, 113 were females (49.56%) with an average age of 31.63 years (SD ± 12.99); males had an average of 34.71 years (SD ± 13.01). Only 3 (1.31%) donors reported chronic diarrhea and nonintentional weight loss; 11 (4.82%) had a family history of CD. For the serological assays, 11 donors (4.82%) were seroreactive to IgA anti-TTG: 3 had high reactivity and 8 had low reactivity. Of those seroreactive to IgA anti-TTG, 3 (1.32%) were also seroreactive to anti-EMA, and they were typed as HLA-DQ8 or HLA-DQ2.

"""32118025""","""Pathogenesis of Celiac Disease and Other Gluten Related Disorders in Wheat and Strategies for Mitigating Them.""","""Wheat is a major cereal crop providing energy and nutrients to the billions of people around the world. Gluten is a structural protein in wheat, that is necessary for its dough making properties, but it is responsible for imparting certain intolerances among some individuals, which are part of this review. Most important among these intolerances is celiac disease, that is gluten triggered T-cell mediated autoimmune enteropathy and results in villous atrophy, inflammation and damage to intestinal lining in genetically liable individuals containing human leukocyte antigen DQ2/DQ8 molecules on antigen presenting cells. Celiac disease occurs due to presence of celiac disease eliciting epitopes in gluten, particularly highly immunogenic alpha-gliadins. Another gluten related disorder is non-celiac gluten-sensitivity in which innate immune-response occurs in patients along with gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal symptoms, that disappear upon removal of gluten from the diet. In wheat allergy, either IgE or non-IgE mediated immune response occurs in individuals after inhalation or ingestion of wheat. Following a life-long gluten-free diet by celiac disease and non-celiac gluten-sensitivity patients is very challenging as none of wheat cultivar or related species stands safe for consumption. Hence, different molecular biology, genetic engineering, breeding, microbial, enzymatic, and chemical strategies have been worked upon to reduce the celiac disease epitopes and the gluten content in wheat. Currently, only 8.4% of total population is affected by wheat-related issues, while rest of population remains safe and should not remove wheat from the diet, based on false media coverage.""","""2020""","[""villous atrophy"", ""celiac disease"", ""human"", ""patients"", ""patient"", ""infant"", ""mammalian"", ""infants"", ""boy"", ""child"", ""woman"", ""humans"", ""children"", ""girl"", ""mammal"", ""boys"", ""participants"", ""women"", ""man"", ""donor"", ""persons"", ""men"", ""person"", ""people"", ""girls"", ""peoples"", ""participant"", ""outpatient"", ""donor variant"", ""patient variant"", ""mammalians"", ""homo sapiens"", ""pt"", ""homo sapiens linnaeus, 1758"", ""pts"", ""h. sapiens"", ""humans. subsp"", ""human pv"", ""hs"", ""mans"", ""patients. variant"", ""patients. str"", ""pats"", ""patients' variant"", ""mammalia"", ""children. pv"", ""p=ns"", ""human variant"", ""pns"", ""ch"", ""hsa"", ""patients, bv"", ""op"", ""child."", ""patients, pv"", ""patients."", ""patients,"", ""patients. pv"", ""para"", ""patients; str"", ""p = ns"", ""p =ns"", ""pten"", ""human bv"", ""ppl"", ""patients (variant"", ""humans, variant"", ""hu"", ""patients (pv"", ""patients pv"", ""humans, bv"", ""human biovar"", ""ptts"", ""pat"", ""patients (bv"", ""women. bv"", ""women. pv"", ""donor pv"", ""patient, variant"", ""human subspecies"", ""d+/r"", ""patients). pv"", ""patients; variant"", ""patient pv"", ""p"", ""patients), str"", ""pn"", ""inflammation"", ""wheat"", ""triticum aestivum"", ""bread wheat"", ""wheats"", ""triticum aestivum l"", ""common wheat"", ""t. aestivum"", ""triticum aestivum, l"", ""aestivum"", ""common wheats"", ""wheat subspecies"", ""bread wheats"", ""t. aestivum l"", ""t.a"", ""triticum vulgare"", ""non-gastrointestinal symptoms"", ""gastrointestinal"", ""allergy"", ""dq2"", ""autoimmune enteropathy"", ""celiac disease epitopes""]"

HLA DQ2/DQ8 can bind gluten peptides after their prior modification by the CD autoantigen, tissue transglutaminase (TG2). This process leads to the activation of gluten reactive T cells, small bowel villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia and intraepithelial lymphocytosis, the histological hallmarks of CD. The clinical picture of CD is extremely heterogeneous including intestinal (especially diarrhea, abdominal pain, bloating) and extraintestinal (especially associated autoimmune diseases, anemia, osteoporosis) manifestations. The prevalence of CD in most parts of the world is estimated at 1:100-1:150 and its diagnosis is based on the presence of circulating autoantibodies (anti-TG2) and the histological detection of villous atrophy. Treatment is a lifelong gluten free diet but adjunctive therapies are in development. Although CD is a well-characterized disease, it is grossly underdiagnosed, despite the severe consequences of long-term gluten ingestion in CD, such as enhanced autoimmunity, refractory CD and intestinal T cell lymphoma.

Almost all celiac patients carry immune recognition genes coding for HLA-DQ2.5 and DQ8 heterodimers. Over the last few years, great importance has been given to HLA-DQ2.2 as probable predisposing variant, although controversies still exist regarding its relevance.The aim of our study was to determine the possible existence of an association between HLA-DQ2.2 and celiac disease in Brazilian children by analyzing the prevalence of the predisposing variants for celiac disease in a representative group of children of a population in which this determination is still missing.HLA-DQ typing was performed in samples from a group of celiac (n=100) and non-celiac children (n=110). All samples were tested for the presence of the following variants: DQA1*05-DQB1*02 (DQ2.5), DQA1*03-DQB1*03:02 (DQ8) and DQA1*02:01-DQB1*02:02 (DQ2.2). Fisher`s exact test was used for statistical analysis.In the group of 100 celiac children, 78 (78%) were positive for DQ2, 13 (13 %) were DQ2/DQ8 and 6 (6%) were DQ8 positives. The HLA-DQ pattern in the 110 non-celiac children was as follows: positive for DQ2 in 33 (29.9%) samples, in 2 (1.8 %) was positive for DQ2/DQ8 and in 15 (13.6%) was positive for DQ8. We found significant differences between the distribution of some but not all of the analyzed alleles when comparing celiac and non-celiac children.The genotyping of celiac disease HLA-DQ predisposing alleles showed similarities with HLA-DQ patterns found in both European and non-European populations, which may be a reflection of the miscegenation, which gave origin to the current Brazilian population.

"""23609110""","""The role of HLA DQ2 and DQ8 in dissecting celiac-like disease in common variable immunodeficiency.""","""<h4>Objectives</h4>Gastrointestinal manifestations are frequent in patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), and some of the patients present with celiac-like features. Diagnosing celiac disease (CD) in CVID however is challenging, as autoantibody detection and histopathology of the small intestine cannot reliably discriminate between classic CD and a celiac-like disease in these individuals. For the development of classic gluten-sensitive CD a certain HLA haplotype involving the loci DQA1* and DQB1* and encoding two different HLA DQ heterodimers is the prerequisite. We aimed to determine the frequency of these haplotypes in CVID patients with suspected CD. Furthermore, we report on autoimmune manifestations and the lymphocyte phenotype in these patients.<h4>Methods</h4>By retrospective analysis data on gastrointestinal symptoms, diet, concurrent autoimmune diseases, and routine laboratory values were collected. CVID patients were classified according to their B-cell phenotype. Expression of HLA-DQA1* and HLA-DQB1* alleles were determined by genetic analysis.<h4>Results</h4>Twenty out of 250 CVID patients presented with a clinical phenotype resembling celiac disease. Four (20%) out of these CVID patients carried the CD-associated HLA DQ2.5 or DQ8 heterodimer, while HLA DQ2.5 was present in 100% of a CD control cohort. Gluten-free diet (GFD) resulted in a clinical and histological response in two out of four patients with HLA high-risk alleles for CD. The response could not be assessed in the remaining two patients, as these patients did not adhere sufficiently long to GFD. The percentage of autoimmune manifestations other than CD was high (50%) in CVID patients presenting with a CD-like enteropathy, and most of these patients had an expansion of B-cells with low expression of CD21 (CD21low B-cells).<h4>Conclusions</h4>In CVID patients with suspected celiac disease typing of the HLA loci DQA1 and DQB1 can help to identify those that have a genetic susceptibility for CD. In CVID patients with a celiac-like phenotype but negative for CD-associated HLA-DQ markers, an autoimmune enteropathy (AIE) as part of an extended autoimmune dysregulation needs to be considered.

The main protein of wheat gluten is called gliadin, the similar proteins of rye and barley are secalin and hordein, respectively. Approximately 96% of CD patients express the HLA molecule DQ2, while the remainder mostly express the less common haplotype DQ8, reflecting the pivotal role of these molecules in the pathogenesis of CD. Because of their aminoacid sequence and tri-dimensional structure, gluten peptides selectively bind to these HLA alleles present on the surface of antigen presenting cells and then they are presented to the T lymphocytes in intestinal mucosa, thus starting the inflammatory immune response. CD is defined by the characteristic histological changes of small bowel mucosa: villous atrophy, crypts hyperplasia and T cells infiltration of the lamina propria, along with the increase of the number of intra-epithelial lymphocytes. The withdrawal of the gluten- containing food from the diet determines a complete recovery of the intestinal mucosa, whereas the reintroduction causes a relapse of the disease. This review focuses on the description of gluten peptides that elicit the mucosal immune response via the activation of innate and adaptive immunity in CD.

The clinical, pathologic, and immunogenetic characteristics of posttransplantation MN and the differences between de novo and recurrent MN are not well understood.<h4>Study design</h4>Multicenter case series.<h4>Setting & participants</h4>We included 77 patients from 5 North American and European medical centers with post-kidney transplantation MN (27 de novo and 50 recurrent). Patients with MN in the native kidney who received kidney allografts but did not develop recurrent MN were used as nonrecurrent controls (n = 43). To improve understanding of posttransplantation MN, we compared de novo MN with recurrent MN and then contrasted recurrent MN with nonrecurrent controls.<h4>Findings</h4>Compared with recurrent MN, de novo MN was less likely to be classified as primary MN (OR, 0.04; P < 0.001) and had more concurrent antibody-mediated rejection (OR, 12.0; P < 0.001) and inferior allograft survival (HR for allograft failure, 3.2; P = 0.007). HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DR17 antigens were more common in recipients with recurrent MN compared with those with de novo MN; however, the frequency of these recipient antigens in recurrent MN was similar to that in nonrecurrent MN controls. Among the 93 kidney transplant recipients with native kidney failure attributed to MN, older recipient age (HR per each year older, 1.03; P = 0.02), recipient HLA-A3 antigen (HR, 2.5; P = 0.003), steroid-free immunosuppressive regimens (HR, 2.84; P < 0.001), and living related allograft (HR, 1.94; P = 0.03) were predictors of MN recurrence.<h4>Limitations</h4>Retrospective case series, limited sample size due to rarity of the disease, nonstandardized nature of data collection and biopsies.<h4>Conclusions</h4>De novo and recurrent MN likely represent separate diseases. De novo MN is associated with humoral alloimmunity and guarded outcome.

Mutations of the CYP21 gene on their corresponding HLA-haplotype were detected by hybridisation of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified genomic DNA with sequence-specific oligonucleotides and solid phase direct sequencing. Our study has shown the following. (1) A single basepair mutation (A-->G or C-->G) within the second intron is the most frequent mutation leading to impaired 21-hydroxylase activity. This mutation is only detected in HLA-haplotypes associated with the salt-wasting form of CAH. (2) A large deletion of part or all of the CYP21 gene is associated with the HLA-haplotype A3, BW47, C6, DR7, DR53, DQ2 but is also observed in other HLA-haplotypes and can be detected by a simple rapid PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism method. (3) Two alleles of the coding CYP21 gene differing in a leucine codon within the first exon, (formerly described as a mutation associated with 21-hydroxylase deficiency) have been found with an equal distribution in patients with 21-hydroxylase deficiency, non-disease HLA-haplotypes and the local healthy controls.""","""1993""","[""21-hydroxylase deficiency"", ""human"", ""patients"", ""patient"", ""infant"", ""mammalian"", ""infants"", ""boy"", ""child"", ""woman"", ""humans"", ""children"", ""girl"", ""mammal"", ""boys"", ""participants"", ""women"", ""man"", ""donor"", ""persons"", ""men"", ""person"", ""people"", ""girls"", ""peoples"", ""participant"", ""outpatient"", ""donor variant"", ""patient variant"", ""mammalians"", ""homo sapiens"", ""pt"", ""homo sapiens linnaeus, 1758"", ""pts"", ""h. sapiens"", ""humans. subsp"", ""human pv"", ""hs"", ""mans"", ""patients. variant"", ""patients. str"", ""pats"", ""patients' variant"", ""mammalia"", ""children. pv"", ""p=ns"", ""human variant"", ""pns"", ""ch"", ""hsa"", ""patients, bv"", ""op"", ""child."", ""patients, pv"", ""patients."", ""patients,"", ""patients. pv"", ""para"", ""patients; str"", ""p = ns"", ""p =ns"", ""pten"", ""human bv"", ""ppl"", ""patients (variant"", ""humans, variant"", ""hu"", ""patients (pv"", ""patients pv"", ""humans, bv"", ""human biovar"", ""ptts"", ""pat"", ""patients (bv"", ""women. bv"", ""women. pv"", ""donor pv"", ""patient, variant"", ""human subspecies"", ""d+/r"", ""patients). pv"", ""patients; variant"", ""patient pv"", ""p"", ""patients), str"", ""pn"", ""cah"", ""cyp21"", ""congenital adrenal hyperplasia"", ""dq2"", ""salt"", ""c4b"", ""c4a"", ""non-disease""]"

"""11232488""","""Refractory coeliac disease: a window between coeliac disease and enteropathy associated T cell lymphoma.""","""The treatment of coeliac disease (CD) is straightforward and simple: life-long adherence to a gluten-free diet. However, in a small subgroup of patients, the clinical and histological abnormalities persist or recur. This non-responsiveness leaves a poorly understood syndrome known as refractory coeliac disease (RCD). A specific definition of RCD is lacking in the literature. We speculate that RCD may appear in a subgroup of coeliacs with persisting histologic abnormalities. In all patients screened for RCD we look for DQ2 and DQ8. In non-DQ2/DQ8 patients we reconsider the diagnosis of CD and of auto-immune enteropathy. Most of the patients referred to us because of suspicion of RCD are affected by other diseases. Probably the commonest cause of non-responsiveness is continued gluten intake. Exocrine pancreas insufficiency, hyperthyroid disease, collagenous colitis are other common explanations. RCD and enteropathy-associated T cell lymphomas (EATL) can be distinguished by intra-epithelial lymphocyte phenotyping and TCR-gamma gene rearrangements. In RCD, an unexplained sustained stimulation of T cell cytotoxic activity is present. Immunosuppressive treatment might moderate this. Cyclosporine has been reported as a resounding success in case reports; however, our results were disappointing. We suggest azathioprine and steroids in RCD without aberrant T-lymphocytes in their mucosa. However, in RCD with aberrant T-lymphocytes we suggest chemotherapy. As the prognosis of EATLs is extremely poor the early detection of RCD with aberrant T cells is crucial.""","""2000""","[""enteropathy associated t cell lymphoma"", ""cyclosporine"", ""steroids"", ""human"", ""patients"", ""patient"", ""infant"", ""mammalian"", ""infants"", ""boy"", ""child"", ""woman"", ""humans"", ""children"", ""girl"", ""mammal"", ""boys"", ""participants"", ""women"", ""man"", ""donor"", ""persons"", ""men"", ""person"", ""people"", ""girls"", ""peoples"", ""participant"", ""outpatient"", ""donor variant"", ""patient variant"", ""mammalians"", ""homo sapiens"", ""pt"", ""homo sapiens linnaeus, 1758"", ""pts"", ""h. sapiens"", ""humans. subsp"", ""human pv"", ""hs"", ""mans"", ""patients. variant"", ""patients. str"", ""pats"", ""patients' variant"", ""mammalia"", ""children. pv"", ""p=ns"", ""human variant"", ""pns"", ""ch"", ""hsa"", ""patients, bv"", ""op"", ""child."", ""patients, pv"", ""patients."", ""patients,"", ""patients. pv"", ""para"", ""patients; str"", ""p = ns"", ""p =ns"", ""pten"", ""human bv"", ""ppl"", ""patients (variant"", ""humans, variant"", ""hu"", ""patients (pv"", ""patients pv"", ""humans, bv"", ""human biovar"", ""ptts"", ""pat"", ""patients (bv"", ""women. bv"", ""women. pv"", ""donor pv"", ""patient, variant"", ""human subspecies"", ""d+/r"", ""patients). pv"", ""patients; variant"", ""patient pv"", ""p"", ""patients), str"", ""pn"", ""enteropathy-associated t cell lymphomas"", ""rcd"", ""collagenous colitis"", ""dq2"", ""azathioprine"", ""enteropathy"", ""pancreas insufficiency"", ""hyperthyroid disease"", ""cd""]"

Demographic, clinical, genetic, histological and IgG-based antibodies were collected at diagnosis and follow-up.<h4>Results</h4>Eighty-six children were included, 60 diagnosed after the guide. Two groups were established: G1 (n = 63) and G2 (n = 23) with or without diagnostic biopsy respectively. In G1: 87.3% were symptomatic, 87.3% had human leukocyte antigan (HLA) DQ2/DQ8 typing (all positive), all had IgG serology positive (71.5% ATG, 35% EMA, 19% DPG, 9.5% AGA), and all had villous atrophy (Marsh-Oberhuber 2-3). Follow-up data were available in 58 children, 34 after 2 years on a gluten-free diet. Fifty-two percentage remained ATG IgG-positive despite good dietary adherence and symptom remission. Regarding G2: all were diagnosed post-2012, had typical symptoms, HLA DQ2/DQ8 positive and ATG IgG × 10 ULN. Additionally, EMA IgG was performed in 14 (60%), all positive.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In our cohort of children with selective IgA deficiency and diagnosed with CD, children without a diagnostic biopsy suggests that IgG serology was considered the equivalent as IgA isotype, even when this is not addressed in the aforementioned guidelines. Great heterogeneity was observed in the IgG serology used at diagnosis.

OBJECTIVE:To determine the frequency and related factors of CD in children with DS, compared with a group of children without DS, analyzing the clinical, im munological, and genetic manifestations. PATIENTS AND METHOD:A total of 209 children between 1-18 years of age (8.4 ± 4.1 years, 55.5% female) were studied, 97 with DS and 112 without DS, using anti-transglutaminase antibodies as serological marker (tTG2). Variables of age, gender, race, ori gin, weight, height, and digestive symptoms were studied. Children with positive tTG2 underwent duodenal biopsy and genotype. The proportion of children with DS, without DS, and CD was esti mated and their 95% CI; measures of central tendency, univariate and bivariate analysis, considering a p < 0.05 significant. RESULTS:Eight children with DS (8.2%) and five children without DS (4.5%) were tTG2 positive (p = 0.200). None presented serum IgA deficiency. One child with DS presented CD with Marsh II (1.0%), and two children with DS (2.1%) and two without DS (1.8%), presen ted potential CD (p = 0.432). Three children were HLA-DQ2. CD was more likely in the preschool group (OR = 6.14 95%CI = 0.41-87.35 p = 0.0462).

The screening for CD was performed by an Elisa IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody (tTGA) testing, combined with IgA quantification by nephelometry. Positive-IgA-tTGA cases were secondly tested for anti-endomysial antibodies (EMA) using an immunofluorescence technique, and the IgA deficiency cases were screened for IgG-tTGA. Patients with low positive tTGA titers underwent HLA-DQ2/DQ8 typing. Sociodemographic and clinical data of the patients were collected using a hetero-administered questionnaire. The comparison of clinical and biological data between seropositive and seronegative diabetics was done using independent <i>T</i>, Mann-Whitney <i>U</i>, chi-squared, and Fisher tests, which were considered significant if <i>p</i> value <0.05.<h4>Results</h4>The prevalence of CD-specific auto-antibodies was estimated to be 9.1% (IC = 95%), with 25 positive cases in tTGA and EMA testing. Eight cases displayed low titers of IgA-tTGA, among which 4 were positive for HLA-DQ2, 1 for HLA-DQ8, and 1 for both DQ2 and DQ8. The other 2 cases had a biopsy-proven CD. Compared to seronegative patients, seropositive cases had a higher percentage of associated autoimmune disorders (16% vs. 2.4%, <i>p</i>=0.008), with a significant lower height Z-scores (median: -0.90 (-3.93 to 0.95) vs. -0.51 (-4.54 to 2.18), <i>p</i>=0.029) and a higher HbA1c level (median: 11.30% (7.31 to 16.00) vs. 9.30% (4.40 to17.31), <i>p</i>=0.022).<h4>Conclusion</h4>The current study gave evidence of a high prevalence of CD specific auto-antibodies in T1D population.

MATERIAL AND METHODS:Thirty-three children with ASD (group 1) and 8 with DS (group 2), aged from 2.5 to 15 years, were examined. There were 27 boys and 6 girls in group1, 5 boys and 3 girls in group 2. Most of the children were on a regular diet and only 4 children with ASD kept gluten-free diet (GFD). Using ELI method antibodies to gliadin IgG (AntiGliadin IgG), antibodies to deamidated peptides of gliadin IgA (AntiDGP IgA), immunoglobulin A (IgA) were identified. Haplotypes HLA-DQ2 and DQ8 were determined using PCR. RESULTS:AntiGliadin IgG were identified in 12.1% (4) patients of group 1, with the exception of patients on GFD in 13.8%, and in 50% patients of group 2. One child with ASD had selective IgA deficiency. Haplotypes predisposing to celiac disease had 41.9% of patients of group 1 and 37.5% of patients of group 2. In ASD, the distribution of genotypes was as follows: DQ2 (64.3%), DQ8 (28.6%), DQ2/DQ8 (7.1%,). In DS, all patients had haplotype DQ2. AntiDGP IgA were not identified in both groups. CONCLUSION:The predominant form of gluten intolerance in children with ASD and DS is sensitivity to gluten, which can be identified in 40-50% of patients. Celiac disease, an autoimmune form of gluten intolerance, can be diagnosed in single cases, although predisposition to it is identified in 41.9% - 37.5% patients with ASD and DS, respectively.

To evaluate the contribution of these genetic loci to other families with familial \""non-DYT1\"" dystonia five large families with dystonia were studied using genetic markers spanning the DYT6 and DYT7 regions. There was no evidence of linkage to either locus in any family. These findings illustrate the genetic heterogeneity of the dystonias and indicate the existence of one or more as yet unmapped genes for dystonia. Large collaborative efforts will be required to identify these, and additional genes, causing PTD.""","""1999""","[""primary torsion dystonia"", ""dyt1"", ""gag"", ""gag+"", ""ptd"", ""dyt6"", ""dystonia"", ""dystonias"", ""dyt7""]"

The role of known causes of dystonia has not been comprehensively investigated in this family, nor has the possible relationship with Wilson disease (WND) in 2 siblings. Eighteen family members were neurologically examined, and DNA samples were obtained. Linkage analysis was performed to DYT1, DYT6, DYT7, DYT11, DYT13, DYT15, and ATP7B with microsatellite markers and the THAP1 (DYT6), PRKRA (DYT16), and ATP7B (WND) genes were sequenced. Reevaluation of the family identified 9 living affected family members, 6 of whom are newly affected. Phenotypic expression was variable, ranging from isolated spasmodic dysphonia (often with mild craniocervical dystonia) to severe generalized dystonia. Two newly described features included an extrusional tongue dystonia and a unique \""hobby horse gait.\"" Genetic analyses excluded all tested loci. Haplotype analysis of the ATP7B region resulted in three different combinations of the two parental alleles in the 8 investigated siblings of the 2 deceased WND patients, indicating that the fourth combination (of two mutated alleles) had occurred only in the deceased WND patients. On these two alleles, we identified a missense (c.2297C>G; p.T766R) and a splice-site mutation (IVS5+1G>T). The c.2297C>G mutation was detected in 3 affected and 4 unaffected family members, whereas the IVS5+1G>T mutation was detected in 1 affected and unaffected family member. Five DYT4 patients carried neither mutation. DYT4 is a familial form of dystonia unrelated to known dystonia genes and loci.

Recently, two mutations in THAP1, the gene that encodes THAP (thanatos-associated protein) domain-containing apoptosis-associated protein 1 (THAP1), have been identified as a cause of DYT6 dystonia.<h4>Methods</h4>We screened THAP1 by sequence analysis and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 160 white patients of European ancestry who had dystonia with an early age at onset (n=64), generalised dystonia (n=35), a positive family history of dystonia (n=56), or facial or laryngeal dystonia. Another 160 patients with dystonia were screened for reported and novel variants in THAP1. 280 neurologically healthy controls were screened for the newly identified and previously reported changes in THAP1 and these and an additional 75 controls were screened for a rare non-coding mutation.<h4>Findings</h4>We identified two mutations in THAP1 (388_389delTC and 474delA), respectively, in two (1%) German patients from the 160 patients with dystonia. Both mutation carriers had laryngeal dystonia that started in childhood and both went on to develop generalised dystonia. Thus, two of three patients with early-onset generalised dystonia with orobulbar involvement had mutations in THAP1. One of the identified patients with DYT6 dystonia had two family members with subtle motor signs who also carried the same mutation. A rare substitution in the 5'untranslated region (-236_235GA-->TT) was found in 20 of 320 patients and in seven of 355 controls (p=0.0054).<h4>Interpretation</h4>Although mutations in THAP1 might have only a minor role in patients with different, but mainly focal, forms of dystonia, they do seem to be associated with early-onset generalised dystonia with spasmodic dysphonia. This combination of symptoms might be a characteristic feature of DYT6 dystonia and could be useful in the differential diagnosis of DYT1, DYT4, DYT12, and DYT17 dystonia. In addition to the identified mutations, a rare non-coding substitution in THAP1 might increase the risk of dystonia.<h4>Funding</h4>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; Volkswagen Foundation; Dystonia Medical Research Foundation; University of Lübeck.""","""2009""","[""thap (thanatos-associated protein) domain-containing apoptosis-associated protein 1"", ""c.474dela"", ""474dela"", ""human"", ""patients"", ""patient"", ""infant"", ""mammalian"", ""infants"", ""boy"", ""child"", ""woman"", ""humans"", ""children"", ""girl"", ""mammal"", ""boys"", ""participants"", ""women"", ""man"", ""donor"", ""persons"", ""men"", ""person"", ""people"", ""girls"", ""peoples"", ""participant"", ""outpatient"", ""donor variant"", ""patient variant"", ""mammalians"", ""homo sapiens"", ""pt"", ""homo sapiens linnaeus, 1758"", ""pts"", ""h. sapiens"", ""humans. subsp"", ""human pv"", ""hs"", ""mans"", ""patients. variant"", ""patients. str"", ""pats"", ""patients' variant"", ""mammalia"", ""children. pv"", ""p=ns"", ""human variant"", ""pns"", ""ch"", ""hsa"", ""patients, bv"", ""op"", ""child."", ""patients, pv"", ""patients."", ""patients,"", ""patients. pv"", ""para"", ""patients; str"", ""p = ns"", ""p =ns"", ""pten"", ""human bv"", ""ppl"", ""patients (variant"", ""humans, variant"", ""hu"", ""patients (pv"", ""patients pv"", ""humans, bv"", ""human biovar"", ""ptts"", ""pat"", ""patients (bv"", ""women. bv"", ""women. pv"", ""donor pv"", ""patient, variant"", ""human subspecies"", ""d+/r"", ""patients). pv"", ""patients; variant"", ""patient pv"", ""p"", ""patients), str"", ""pn"", ""thap1"", ""dyt12"", ""torsion dystonia"", ""dyt4"", ""spasmodic dysphonia"", ""dyt6"", ""dystonia"", ""laryngeal dystonia"", ""388_389deltc"", ""dyt1"", ""dyt17""]"

To assess more broadly the role of this gene, we screened for mutations in families that included one family member who had early-onset, non-focal primary dystonia.<h4>Methods</h4>We identified 36 non-DYT1 multiplex families in which at least one person had non-focal involvement at an age of onset that was younger than 22 years. All three coding exons of THAP1 were sequenced, and the clinical features of individuals with mutations were compared with those of individuals who were negative for mutations in THAP1. Genotype-phenotype differences were also assessed.<h4>Findings</h4>Of 36 families, nine (25%) had members with mutations in THAP1, and most were of German, Irish, or Italian ancestry. One family had the Amish-Mennonite founder mutation, whereas the other eight families each had novel, potentially truncating or missense mutations. The clinical features of the families with mutations conformed to the previously described DYT6 phenotype; however, age at onset was extended from 38 years to 49 years. Compared with non-carriers, mutation carriers were younger at onset and their dystonia was more likely to begin in brachial, rather than cervical, muscles, become generalised, and include speech involvement. Genotype-phenotype differences were not found.<h4>Interpretation</h4>Mutations in THAP1 underlie a substantial proportion of early-onset primary dystonia in non-DYT1 families. The clinical features that are characteristic of affected individuals who have mutations in THAP1 include limb and cranial muscle involvement, and speech is often affected.<h4>Funding</h4>Dystonia Medical Research Foundation; Bachmann-Strauss Dystonia and Parkinson Foundation; National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke; Aaron Aronov Family Foundation.""","""2009""","[""primary dystonia"", ""stroke"", ""neurological disorders"", ""dyt1"", ""thap1"", ""dyt6"", ""bachmann-strauss dystonia and parkinson"", ""dystonia"", ""cranial muscle involvement""]"

Recently, the THAP1 gene was identified as the cause of DYT6, where a total of 13 mutations have been identified in Amish-Mennonite and European families.<h4>Methods</h4>We sequenced the THAP1 gene in a series of 362 British, genetically undetermined, primary dystonia patients (78 with focal, 186 with segmental, and 98 with generalized dystonia) and in 28 dystonia-manifesting DYT1 patients and 176 normal control individuals.<h4>Results</h4>Nine coding mutations were identified in the THAP1 gene. Two were small deletions, 2 were nonsense, and 5 were missense. Eight mutations were heterozygous, and 1 was homozygous. The main clinical presentation of cases with THAP1 mutations was early-onset (<30 years) dystonia in the craniocervical region or the limbs (8 of 9 patients). There was phenotypic variability with laryngeal or oromandibular dystonia present in 3 cases. Four of 9 THAP1 cases developed generalized dystonia.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The number of THAP1 mutations has been significantly expanded, indicating an uncommon but important cause of dystonia. Coding mutations account for 9 of 362 dystonia cases, indicating a mutation frequency of 2.5% of dystonia cases in the population that we have screened. The majority of cases reported here with THAP1 mutations had craniocervical- or limb-onset segmental dystonia, but we also identified 1 homozygous THAP1 mutation, associated initially with writer's dystonia and then developing segmental dystonia. Three of our patients had a nonsense or frameshift THAP1 mutation and the clinical features of laryngeal or oromandibular dystonia.

Six children ages 15-17 years old underwent awake microelectrode-guided surgery. For 25 children operated under general anesthesia, the surgical technique evolved from microelectrode-guided surgery to image-guided surgeries using real-time intraoperative MR imaging or CT for lead location confirmation. Complications included 5 hardware infections, all in children younger than 10 years old. At 1 year after implantation, patients with DYT1 dystonia had a mean improvement in the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale movement subscore of 75%, while those with secondary dystonia had only small improvements. Outcomes in the 3 children with NBIA were disappointing.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Results of DBS in children with primary and secondary dystonias were similar to those in adults, with excellent results for DYT1 dystonia in children without fixed orthopedic deformity and much more modest results in secondary dystonia. In contrast to reported experience in adults with NBIA, these results in children with NBIA were poor.

There are a number of known genetic forms of dystonia (DYT1-27); however the heterogeneity of disease presentation does not always make it easy to categorize the disease by phenotype-genotype comparison.<h4>Case presentation</h4>In this report, we describe a 53-year-old female who presented initially with hand tremor following a total hip arthroplasty. The patient developed a mixed hyperkinetic disorder consisting of chorea, dystonia affecting the upper extremities, dysarthria, and blepharospasm. Whole exome sequencing of the patient revealed a novel heterozygous missense variant (Chr11(GRCh38): g.26525644C > G; NM_031418.2(ANO3): c.702C > G; NP_113606.2. p.C234W) in exon 7 in the ANO3 gene.<h4>Conclusions</h4>ANO3 encodes anoctamin-3, a Ca<sup>+2</sup>-dependent phospholipid scramblase expressed in striatal-neurons, that has been implicated in autosomal dominant craniocervical dystonia (Dystonia-24, DYT24, MIM# 615034).

Five blinded raters (two fellowship-trained laryngologists and three speech/language pathologists) evaluated audio recordings of each patient pre- and post-DBS.

There is limited information, however, on outcomes after iMRI-guided DBS for dystonia. The authors evaluated clinical outcomes and targeting accuracy in patients with dystonia who underwent lead placement using an iMRI targeting platform.<h4>Methods</h4>Patients with dystonia undergoing iMRI-guided lead placement in the globus pallidus pars internus (GPi) were identified. Patients with a prior ablative or MER-guided procedure were excluded from clinical outcomes analysis. Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale (BFMDRS) scores and Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS) scores were assessed preoperatively and at 6 and 12 months postoperatively. Other measures analyzed include lead accuracy, complications/adverse events, and stimulation parameters.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 60 leads were implanted in 30 patients. Stereotactic lead accuracy in the axial plane was 0.93 ± 0.12 mm from the intended target. Nineteen patients (idiopathic focal, n = 7; idiopathic segmental, n = 5; DYT1, n = 1; tardive, n = 2; other secondary, n = 4) were included in clinical outcomes analysis. The mean improvement in BFMDRS score was 51.9% ± 9.7% at 6 months and 63.4% ± 8.0% at 1 year. TWSTRS scores in patients with predominant cervical dystonia (n = 13) improved by 53.3% ± 10.5% at 6 months and 67.6% ± 9.0% at 1 year. Serious complications occurred in 6 patients (20%), involving 8 of 60 implanted leads (13.3%). The rate of serious complications across all patients undergoing iMRI-guided DBS at the authors' institution was further reviewed, including an additional 53 patients undergoing GPi-DBS for Parkinson disease. In this expanded cohort, serious complications occurred in 11 patients (13.3%) involving 15 leads (10.1%).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Intraoperative MRI-guided lead placement in patients with dystonia showed improvement in clinical outcomes comparable to previously reported results using awake MER-guided lead placement. The accuracy of lead placement was high, and the procedure was well tolerated in the majority of patients.

DYT1 dystonia patients show trends of decreased striatal ligand-binding activities to dopamine receptors 1 (D1R) and 2 (D2R). Dyt1 ΔGAG knock-in (KI) mice, which have the corresponding ΔGAG deletion, similarly exhibit reduced striatal D1R and D2R-binding activities and their expression levels. While the consequences of D2R reduction have been well characterized, relatively little is known about the effect of D1R reduction. Here, locomotor responses to D1R and D2R antagonists were examined in Dyt1 KI mice. Dyt1 KI mice showed significantly less responsiveness to both D1R antagonist SCH 23390 and D2R antagonist raclopride. The electrophysiological recording indicated that Dyt1 KI mice showed a significantly increased paired-pulse ratio of the striatal D1R-expressing medium spiny neurons and altered miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents. To analyze the in vivo torsinA function in the D1R-expressing neurons further, Dyt1 conditional knockout (Dyt1 d1KO) mice in these neurons were generated. Dyt1 d1KO mice had decreased spontaneous locomotor activity and reduced numbers of slips in the beam-walking test. Dyt1 d1KO male mice showed abnormal gait. Dyt1 d1KO mice showed defective striatal D1R maturation. Moreover, the mutant striatal D1R-expressing medium spiny neurons had increased capacitance, decreased sEPSC frequency, and reduced intrinsic excitability.

What is not known is how torsinA dysfunction in these specific cell types contributes to the pathophysiology of DYT1 dystonia. In this study we sought to determine whether torsinA dysfunction in cholinergic neurons alone is sufficient to generate the sensorimotor dysfunction and brain changes associated with dystonia, or if torsinA dysfunction in a broader subset of cell types is needed. We generated two genetically modified mouse models, one with selective Dyt1 knock-out from dopamine-2 receptor expressing neurons (D2KO) and one where only cholinergic neurons are impacted (Ch2KO). We assessed motor deficits and performed in vivo 11.1 T functional MRI to assess sensory-evoked brain activation and connectivity, along with diffusion MRI to assess brain microstructure. We found that D2KO mice showed greater impairment than Ch2KO mice, including reduced sensory-evoked brain activity in key regions of the sensorimotor network, and altered functional connectivity of the striatum that correlated with motor deficits.

LOCUS DYT-1 PRIMARY DYSTONIA: Locus DYT1, situated on chromosome 9, is responsible for the most common phenotypic expression of generalized primary dystonia, Ziehen-Oppenheim disease. This autosomal dominant disease has variable penetration. It has long been recognized that some individuals in families with typical disease only have segmentary, multifocal or even focal dystonia. It has been proven by molecular genetics that the disease can be expressed simply by familial writers cramp with particularly early, and often bilateral, onset. The mutation concerns the torsine A gene, whose function remains to be elucidated. Torsine A is found in the central nervous system, particularly in the dopaminergic neurons of the locus niger. GENERALIZED PRIMARY DYSTONIA UNRELATED TO DYT-1: These dystonias are phenotypically different: younger and more variable age at onset, focal localization early in the disease course generally involving the cervical or cephalic pole, less severe course. Certain forms are linked to chromosome 8 (locus DYT 6). PRIMARY FOCAL OR SEGMENTARY DYSTONIAS: These primary dystonias cause functional or postural disorders and were long considered as sporadic despite rare familial cases suggesting a genetic factor. When searched for systematically, familial cases are found in 20 to 30% of the cases. The dystonia is transmitted by dominant autosomal heredity with reduced penetration. Phenotypically, expression is heterogeneous with a constant frequency of unrecognized or neglected forms and of postural forms. One form is known to be linked to chromosome 18 (locus DYT 7). DOPA-RESPONSIVE DYSTONIA: This class represents 5 to 10% of childhood dystonias. The phenotypic expression is polymorphous but symptoms always improve with very small doses of L-dopa. Both sporadic, and more frequently familial, cases are described. Some forms are recessive, caused by mutation of the gene coding for tyrosine hydroxylase, others are autosomal dominant, often linked to mutation of the gene coding for GTP cyclohydrolase.

Awareness of the diverse etiologic categories of childhood-onset dystonia is necessary to accurate diagnosis approach. Clinical examination and cerebral magnetic resonance imaging are the keys of this diagnosis approach. Primary dystonia is defined as syndromes in which dystonia is the sole phenotypic manifestation (especially no cognitive deterioration is observed, and brain MRI is normal); DYT1 dystonia, in which the abnormal gene is located on chromosome 9, is the most frequent childhood-onset primary dystonia; progressive generalisation of the abnormal movements occur in 70p.cent of the patients.

Clinical presentation of DRD might be atypical (mimicking cerebral palsy or isolated limb pain without diurnal fluctuation). DRD is rare, but a trial of L-dopa should be performed on all patients with childhood-onset dystonia, lasting at least one month. Secondary dystonias or heredodegenerative diseases are the most frequent etiology of childhood-onset dystonic syndromes. Among a huge range of heredodegenerative disease, those that are amenable to a specific treatment, such as Wilson's disease or creatine deficiency, should be particularly investigated. The main objective of investigation of dystonia is to identify secondary dystonias or heredodegenerative diseases. Further investigations will be performed according to the clinical characteristics of the dystonia, to the presence of associated neurological or extraneurological symptoms, and according to brain imaging; this approach must be discussed for each single patient.

"""19685389""","""[Genetics of dystonia].""","""The dystonias comprise a heterogeneous group of movement disorders. In contrast to the frequent sporadic forms, a variety of rare familial forms are caused by genetic mutations with mendelian inheritance. In recent years, significant progress has been made with regard to the identification of genes causing dystonia, and to the molecular pathophysiology underlying dystonic symptoms. Currently, 18 gene loci have been described causing primary dystonia, dystonia-plus syndromes or paroxysmal dystonia. The most frequent form of inherited dystonia, according to current knowledge, is early-onset generalized DYT1 dystonia, caused by a deletion of three basepairs, GAG, in the DYT1 (TOR1A) gene. It is thought that the protein encoded by this gene, torsinA, participates in association of the endoplasmatic reticulum and the nuclear envelope with the cytoskeleton and hereby might influence the reaction of cells to various stresses and/or the development of specific neuronal populations involved in movement control in the brain. Other genes which have only recently been identified include: THAP1, causing adolescent-onset primary dystonia of mixed type (DYT6); ATP1A3, responsible for Rapid-Onset Dystonia-Parkinsonism (RDP, DYT12); PRKRA, causing young-onset dystonia-parkinsonism (DYT16); and SLC2A1, causing paroxysmal exertion-induced dystonia with haemolytic anemia (DYT18).

THAP1 encodes a transcription factor that represses the expression of DYT1. To further evaluate the mutational spectrum of THAP1 and its associated phenotype, we sequenced THAP1 in 567 patients with focal (n = 461), segmental (n = 68), or generalized dystonia (n = 38). We identified 10 novel variants, including six missense substitutions within the DNA-binding Thanatos-associated protein domain (Arg13His, Lys16Glu, His23Pro, Lys24Glu, Pro26Leu, Ile80Val), a 1bp-deletion downstream of the nuclear localization signal (Asp191Thrfs*9), and three alterations in the untranslated regions. The effect of the missense variants was assessed using prediction tools and luciferase reporter gene assays. This indicated the Ile80Val substitution as a benign variant. The subcellular localization of Asp191Thrfs*9 suggests a disturbed nuclear import for this mutation. Thus, we consider six of the 10 novel variants as pathogenic mutations accounting for a mutation frequency of 1.1%. Mutation carriers presented mainly with early onset dystonia (<12 years in five of six patients). Symptoms started in an arm or neck and spread to become generalized in three patients or segmental in two patients. Speech was affected in four mutation carriers.

"""28843013""","""It's not just the basal ganglia: Cerebellum as a target for dystonia therapeutics.""","""Dystonia is a common movement disorder that devastates the lives of many patients, but the etiology of this disorder remains poorly understood. Dystonia has traditionally been considered a disorder of the basal ganglia. However, growing evidence suggests that the cerebellum may be involved in certain types of dystonia, raising several questions. Can different types of dystonia be classified as either a basal ganglia disorder or a cerebellar disorder? Is dystonia a network disorder that involves the cerebellum and basal ganglia? If dystonia is a network disorder, how can we target treatments to alleviate symptoms in patients? A recent study by Chen et al, using the pharmacological mouse model of rapid-onset dystonia parkinsonism, has provided some insight into these important questions. They showed that the cerebellum can directly modulate basal ganglia activity through a short latency cerebello-thalamo-basal ganglia pathway. Further, this article and others have provided evidence that in some cases, aberrant cerebello-basal ganglia communication can be involved in dystonia. In this review we examine the evidence for the involvement of the cerebellum and cerebello-basal ganglia interactions in dystonia. We conclude that there is ample evidence to suggest that the cerebellum plays a role in some dystonias, including the early-onset primary torsion dystonia DYT1 and that further studies examining the role of this brain region and its interaction with the basal ganglia in dystonia are warranted. © 2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.""","""2017""","[""primary torsion dystonia"", ""human"", ""patients"", ""patient"", ""infant"", ""mammalian"", ""infants"", ""boy"", ""child"", ""woman"", ""humans"", ""children"", ""girl"", ""mammal"", ""boys"", ""participants"", ""women"", ""man"", ""donor"", ""persons"", ""men"", ""person"", ""people"", ""girls"", ""peoples"", ""participant"", ""outpatient"", ""donor variant"", ""patient variant"", ""mammalians"", ""homo sapiens"", ""pt"", ""homo sapiens linnaeus, 1758"", ""pts"", ""h. sapiens"", ""humans. subsp"", ""human pv"", ""hs"", ""mans"", ""patients. variant"", ""patients. str"", ""pats"", ""patients' variant"", ""mammalia"", ""children. pv"", ""p=ns"", ""human variant"", ""pns"", ""ch"", ""hsa"", ""patients, bv"", ""op"", ""child."", ""patients, pv"", ""patients."", ""patients,"", ""patients. pv"", ""para"", ""patients; str"", ""p = ns"", ""p =ns"", ""pten"", ""human bv"", ""ppl"", ""patients (variant"", ""humans, variant"", ""hu"", ""patients (pv"", ""patients pv"", ""humans, bv"", ""human biovar"", ""ptts"", ""pat"", ""patients (bv"", ""women. bv"", ""women. pv"", ""donor pv"", ""patient, variant"", ""human subspecies"", ""d+/r"", ""patients). pv"", ""patients; variant"", ""patient pv"", ""p"", ""patients), str"", ""pn"", ""mice"", ""mouse"", ""murine"", ""transgenic mice"", ""nude mice"", ""transgenic"", ""mice (pv"", ""mus musculus"", ""house mouse"", ""m. musculus"", ""129/sv"", ""mmu"", ""t/+ mice"", ""mice,"", ""129sv"", ""n/+ mice"", ""mouse variant"", ""mice."", ""mouse:"", ""129 sv"", ""tgm"", ""house mouse subspecies"", ""tg mice"", ""mouse strain"", ""tg"", ""mice. pv"", ""mice. bv"", ""h-/- mouse"", ""mouse substrain"", ""transgenic) mice"", ""t. mice"", ""tr"", ""m:c"", ""mo"", ""h/+ mouse"", ""mice (strain"", ""mu"", ""nude\"" mice"", ""murine str"", ""mouses"", ""nude             mice"", ""tg-mice"", ""transgenic-mice"", ""nm"", ""n (+/+) mice"", ""n(-/-)) mice"", ""n(-/-) mice"", ""mouse biovar"", ""n  mice"", ""mouse subspecies"", ""h mouse"", ""mice. variant"", ""tm"", ""mus musculus,"", ""transgenic, mice"", ""nude-mice"", ""m. m"", ""dyt1"", ""basal ganglia disorder"", ""movement disorder"", ""dystonia parkinsonism"", ""parkinson and movement disorder society"", ""dystonias"", ""cerebellar disorder"", ""dystonia""]"
"""24311730""","""TorsinA rescues ER-associated stress and locomotive defects in C. elegans models of ALS.""","""Molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative diseases converge at the interface of pathways impacting cellular stress, protein homeostasis and aging. Targeting the intrinsic capacities of neuroprotective proteins to restore neuronal function and/or attenuate degeneration represents a potential means toward therapeutic intervention. The product of the human DYT1 gene, torsinA, is a member of the functionally diverse AAA+ family of proteins and exhibits robust molecular-chaperone-like activity, both in vitro and in vivo. Although mutations in DYT1 are associated with a rare form of heritable generalized dystonia, the native function of torsinA seems to be cytoprotective in maintaining the cellular threshold to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Here we explore the potential for torsinA to serve as a buffer to attenuate the cellular consequences of misfolded-protein stress as it pertains to the neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The selective vulnerability of motor neurons to degeneration in ALS mouse models harboring mutations in superoxide dismutase (SOD1) has been found to correlate with regional-specific ER stress in brains. Using Caenorhabditis elegans as a system to model ER stress, we generated transgenic nematodes overexpressing either wild-type or mutant human SOD1 to evaluate their relative impact on ER stress induction in vivo. These studies revealed a mutant-SOD1-specific increase in ER stress that was further exacerbated by changes in temperature, all of which was robustly attenuated by co-expression of torsinA. Moreover, through complementary behavioral analysis, torsinA was able to restore normal neuronal function in mutant G85R SOD1 animals. Furthermore, torsinA targeted mutant SOD1 for degradation via the proteasome, representing mechanistic insight on the activity that torsinA has on aggregate-prone proteins. These results expand our understanding of proteostatic mechanisms influencing neuronal dysfunction in ALS, while simultaneously highlighting the potential for torsinA as a novel target for therapeutic development.""","""2013""","[""neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis"", ""caenorhabditis elegans"", ""c. elegans"", ""caenorhabditiselegans"", ""roundworm"", ""c.elegans"", ""c elegans"", ""ce"", ""c-elegans"", ""caenorhabditis"", ""mice"", ""mouse"", ""murine"", ""transgenic mice"", ""nude mice"", ""transgenic"", ""mice (pv"", ""mus musculus"", ""house mouse"", ""m. musculus"", ""129/sv"", ""mmu"", ""t/+ mice"", ""mice,"", ""129sv"", ""n/+ mice"", ""mouse variant"", ""mice."", ""mouse:"", ""129 sv"", ""tgm"", ""house mouse subspecies"", ""tg mice"", ""mouse strain"", ""tg"", ""mice. pv"", ""mice. bv"", ""h-/- mouse"", ""mouse substrain"", ""transgenic) mice"", ""t. mice"", ""tr"", ""m:c"", ""mo"", ""h/+ mouse"", ""mice (strain"", ""mu"", ""nude\"" mice"", ""murine str"", ""mouses"", ""nude             mice"", ""tg-mice"", ""transgenic-mice"", ""nm"", ""n (+/+) mice"", ""n(-/-)) mice"", ""n(-/-) mice"", ""mouse biovar"", ""n  mice"", ""mouse subspecies"", ""h mouse"", ""mice. variant"", ""tm"", ""mus musculus,"", ""transgenic, mice"", ""nude-mice"", ""m. m"", ""sod1"", ""dystonia"", ""human"", ""patients"", ""patient"", ""infant"", ""mammalian"", ""infants"", ""boy"", ""child"", ""woman"", ""humans"", ""children"", ""girl"", ""mammal"", ""boys"", ""participants"", ""women"", ""man"", ""donor"", ""persons"", ""men"", ""person"", ""people"", ""girls"", ""peoples"", ""participant"", ""outpatient"", ""donor variant"", ""patient variant"", ""mammalians"", ""homo sapiens"", ""pt"", ""homo sapiens linnaeus, 1758"", ""pts"", ""h. sapiens"", ""humans. subsp"", ""human pv"", ""hs"", ""mans"", ""patients. variant"", ""patients. str"", ""pats"", ""patients' variant"", ""mammalia"", ""children. pv"", ""p=ns"", ""human variant"", ""pns"", ""ch"", ""hsa"", ""patients, bv"", ""op"", ""child."", ""patients, pv"", ""patients."", ""patients,"", ""patients. pv"", ""para"", ""patients; str"", ""p = ns"", ""p =ns"", ""pten"", ""human bv"", ""ppl"", ""patients (variant"", ""humans, variant"", ""hu"", ""patients (pv"", ""patients pv"", ""humans, bv"", ""human biovar"", ""ptts"", ""pat"", ""patients (bv"", ""women. bv"", ""women. pv"", ""donor pv"", ""patient, variant"", ""human subspecies"", ""d+/r"", ""patients). pv"", ""patients; variant"", ""patient pv"", ""p"", ""patients), str"", ""pn"", ""torsina"", ""als"", ""g85r"", ""g86r"", ""gly 85 --> arg"", ""neurodegenerative diseases"", ""locomotive defects"", ""dyt1"", ""neuronal dysfunction""]"

"""12151848""","""Dystonia: clinical features, genetics, and treatment.""","""<h4>Purpose of review</h4>The present review covers recent advances in dystonia research related to dystonia genetics and treatment. These have led to the discovery of novel dystonia genes and loci, to changing classification schemes, and to the introduction of improved and new treatment options.<h4>Recent findings</h4>Currently 13 different forms of dystonia can be distinguished on a genetic basis (dystonia types 1-13). Recently, a novel gene locus (DYT13) was detected in a family with segmental dystonia, and the gene causing myoclonus-dystonia was identified (SGCE). Furthermore, a novel mutation in the DYT1 gene is associated with a myoclonus-dystonia phenotype. Regarding dystonia treatment, patients refractory to botulinum toxin type A can now be treated with botulinum toxin type B. Selective peripheral denervation remains an effective form of treatment for patients with secondary, but probably not with primary botulinum toxin treatment failure. Finally, a renaissance of functional surgical ablative procedures has taken place, with high frequency deep brain stimulation being introduced in dystonia treatment. Bilateral pallidotomy or pallidal stimulation may provide major benefit especially in patients with generalized, disabling dystonia with the most dramatic improvements in dystonia type 1 patients. Neurostimulation may also be effective in primary segmental axial dystonia, myoclonus-dystonia, and tardive dystonia.<h4>Summary</h4>The recent mapping of additional dystonia gene loci, the identification of novel dystonia genes, and the characterization of proteins encoded by these genes have enhanced our understanding of various forms and aspects of the dystonias and have opened up new avenues for research. Treatment options include both medical and surgical therapies, with deep brain simulation being the most recent development.""","""2002""","[""human"", ""patients"", ""patient"", ""infant"", ""mammalian"", ""infants"", ""boy"", ""child"", ""woman"", ""humans"", ""children"", ""girl"", ""mammal"", ""boys"", ""participants"", ""women"", ""man"", ""donor"", ""persons"", ""men"", ""person"", ""people"", ""girls"", ""peoples"", ""participant"", ""outpatient"", ""donor variant"", ""patient variant"", ""mammalians"", ""homo sapiens"", ""pt"", ""homo sapiens linnaeus, 1758"", ""pts"", ""h. sapiens"", ""humans. subsp"", ""human pv"", ""hs"", ""mans"", ""patients. variant"", ""patients. str"", ""pats"", ""patients' variant"", ""mammalia"", ""children. pv"", ""p=ns"", ""human variant"", ""pns"", ""ch"", ""hsa"", ""patients, bv"", ""op"", ""child."", ""patients, pv"", ""patients."", ""patients,"", ""patients. pv"", ""para"", ""patients; str"", ""p = ns"", ""p =ns"", ""pten"", ""human bv"", ""ppl"", ""patients (variant"", ""humans, variant"", ""hu"", ""patients (pv"", ""patients pv"", ""humans, bv"", ""human biovar"", ""ptts"", ""pat"", ""patients (bv"", ""women. bv"", ""women. pv"", ""donor pv"", ""patient, variant"", ""human subspecies"", ""d+/r"", ""patients). pv"", ""patients; variant"", ""patient pv"", ""p"", ""patients), str"", ""pn"", ""segmental dystonia"", ""sgce"", ""dystonia"", ""dyt1"", ""tardive dystonia"", ""dyt13"", ""dystonias"", ""myoclonus-dystonia"", ""segmental axial dystonia"", ""dystonia type""]"

Using a DYT1 knock-in mouse model to test efficacy on brain pathologies, we found that ritonavir restored multiple brain abnormalities across development. Ritonavir acutely corrected striatal cholinergic interneuron physiology in the mature brain and yielded sustained correction of diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging signals when delivered during a discrete early developmental window.

Most DYT1 dystonia patients have a heterozygous trinucleotide GAG deletion in DYT1 or TOR1A gene, with a loss of a glutamic acid residue of the protein torsinA. DYT1 dystonia patients show reduced striatal dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) binding activity. We previously reported reduced striatal D2R proteins and impaired corticostriatal plasticity in Dyt1 ΔGAG heterozygous knock-in (Dyt1 KI) mice. It remains unclear how the D2R reduction contributes to the pathogenesis of DYT1 dystonia. Recent knockout studies indicate that D2R on cholinergic interneurons (Chls) has a significant role in corticostriatal plasticity, while D2R on medium spiny neurons (MSNs) plays a minor role. To determine how reduced D2Rs on ChIs and MSNs affect motor performance, we generated ChI- or MSN-specific D2R conditional knockout mice (Drd2 ChKO or Drd2 sKO). The striatal ChIs in the Drd2 ChKO mice showed an increased firing frequency and impaired quinpirole-induced inhibition, suggesting a reduced D2R function on the ChIs. Drd2 ChKO mice had an age-dependent deficient performance on the beam-walking test similar to the Dyt1 KI mice. The Drd2 sKO mice, conversely, had a deficit on the rotarod but not the beam-walking test. Our findings suggest that D2Rs on Chls and MSNs have critical roles in motor control and balance.

Predictive factors for the degree of improvement after GPi DBS include shorter disease duration and dystonia subtype with idiopathic isolated dystonia usually responding better than acquired combined dystonias. Other factors contributing to variability in outcome may include body distribution, pattern of dystonia and DBS related factors such as lead placement and stimulation parameters. The responsiveness to DBS appears to vary between different monogenic forms of dystonia, with some improving more than others. The first observation in this regard was reports of superior DBS outcomes in DYT-TOR1A (DYT1) dystonia, although other studies have found no difference. Recently a subgroup with young onset DYT-TOR1A, more rapid progression and secondary worsening after effective GPi DBS, has been described. Myoclonus dystonia due to DYT-SCGE (DYT11) usually responds well to GPi DBS. Good outcomes following GPi DBS have also been documented in X-linked dystonia Parkinsonism (DYT3).

Formal assessments included both the Burke-Fahn-Marsden dystonia scale and the recently developed Unified Dystonia Rating Scale. Two patients had primary generalized non-DYT1 dystonia, and four suffered from choreoathetosis secondary to infantile cerebral palsy. Bilateral quadripolar DBS electrodes were implanted in all instances, except in one patient with markedly asymmetrical symptoms. There were no adverse events related to surgery. The Burke-Fahn-Marsden scores in the two patients with generalized dystonia improved by 78 and 71% at 3 months, by 82 and 69% at 1 year, and by 78 and 70% at 2 years postoperatively. This was paralleled by marked amelioration of disability scores. The mean improvement in Burke-Fahn-Marsden scores in patients with choreoathetosis was 12% at 3 months, 29% at 1 year, and 23% at 2 years postoperatively, which was not significant. Two of these patients thought that they had achieved marked improvement at 2 years postoperatively, although results of objective evaluations were less impressive. In these two patients there was a minor but stable improvement in disability scores. All patients had an improvement in pain scores at the 2-year follow-up review. Medication was tapered off in both patients with generalized dystonia and reduced in two of the patients with choreoathetosis. All stimulation-induced side effects were reversible on adjustment of the DBS settings. Energy consumption of the batteries was considerably higher than in patients with Parkinson disease. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic pallidal DBS is a safe and effective procedure in generalized non-DYT1 dystonia, and it may become the procedure of choice in patients with medically refractory dystonia. Postoperative improvement of choreoathetosis is more modest and varied, and subjective ratings of outcome may exceed objective evaluations.""","""2003""","[""human"", ""patients"", ""patient"", ""infant"", ""mammalian"", ""infants"", ""boy"", ""child"", ""woman"", ""humans"", ""children"", ""girl"", ""mammal"", ""boys"", ""participants"", ""women"", ""man"", ""donor"", ""persons"", ""men"", ""person"", ""people"", ""girls"", ""peoples"", ""participant"", ""outpatient"", ""donor variant"", ""patient variant"", ""mammalians"", ""homo sapiens"", ""pt"", ""homo sapiens linnaeus, 1758"", ""pts"", ""h. sapiens"", ""humans. subsp"", ""human pv"", ""hs"", ""mans"", ""patients. variant"", ""patients. str"", ""pats"", ""patients' variant"", ""mammalia"", ""children. pv"", ""p=ns"", ""human variant"", ""pns"", ""ch"", ""hsa"", ""patients, bv"", ""op"", ""child."", ""patients, pv"", ""patients."", ""patients,"", ""patients. pv"", ""para"", ""patients; str"", ""p = ns"", ""p =ns"", ""pten"", ""human bv"", ""ppl"", ""patients (variant"", ""humans, variant"", ""hu"", ""patients (pv"", ""patients pv"", ""humans, bv"", ""human biovar"", ""ptts"", ""pat"", ""patients (bv"", ""women. bv"", ""women. pv"", ""donor pv"", ""patient, variant"", ""human subspecies"", ""d+/r"", ""patients). pv"", ""patients; variant"", ""patient pv"", ""p"", ""patients), str"", ""pn"", ""dyt1"", ""choreoathetosis secondary to infantile cerebral palsy"", ""parkinson disease"", ""dystonia"", ""choreoathetosis"", ""oppenheim dystonia"", ""pain""]"

The purpose of this study was to establish whether the sensory system is affected in other types of dystonias and whether the contralateral hand is also involved in FHD. We used a spatial acuity measure (Johnson-Van Boven-Phillips domes) to evaluate sensory spatial discrimination in both hands of patients with different forms of dystonias including primary generalized DYT1 dystonia (associated with a unique deletion in the DYT1 gene) (n = 13), FHD (n = 15), benign essential blepharospasm (n = 9), cervical dystonia (n = 10) and in age-matched controls. Clinical evaluation included the Fahn dystonia scale for the focal dystonia groups and the Marsden-Burke-Fahn scale for the generalized dystonia group. Spatial discrimination was normal in patients with DYT1 dystonia, despite all of these patients having hand dystonia. However, spatial discrimination thresholds were significantly increased in both hands in the focal dystonia groups (thresholds were similar for each group) and did not correlate significantly with either severity or duration of dystonic symptoms. Thresholds were significantly increased in the dominant hand compared with the non-dominant hand only within the FHD group. Our observations demonstrate involvement of both the dominant and non-dominant somatosensory cortices, and suggest that abnormal sensory processing is a fundamental disturbance in patients with focal dystonia. These findings of altered sensory processing in idiopathic focal but not generalized DYT1 dystonia suggest both a primary pathophysiological role for the phenomenon in focal dystonia and divergent pathophysiological processes in the two conditions.""","""2003""","[""human"", ""patients"", ""patient"", ""infant"", ""mammalian"", ""infants"", ""boy"", ""child"", ""woman"", ""humans"", ""children"", ""girl"", ""mammal"", ""boys"", ""participants"", ""women"", ""man"", ""donor"", ""persons"", ""men"", ""person"", ""people"", ""girls"", ""peoples"", ""participant"", ""outpatient"", ""donor variant"", ""patient variant"", ""mammalians"", ""homo sapiens"", ""pt"", ""homo sapiens linnaeus, 1758"", ""pts"", ""h. sapiens"", ""humans. subsp"", ""human pv"", ""hs"", ""mans"", ""patients. variant"", ""patients. str"", ""pats"", ""patients' variant"", ""mammalia"", ""children. pv"", ""p=ns"", ""human variant"", ""pns"", ""ch"", ""hsa"", ""patients, bv"", ""op"", ""child."", ""patients, pv"", ""patients."", ""patients,"", ""patients. pv"", ""para"", ""patients; str"", ""p = ns"", ""p =ns"", ""pten"", ""human bv"", ""ppl"", ""patients (variant"", ""humans, variant"", ""hu"", ""patients (pv"", ""patients pv"", ""humans, bv"", ""human biovar"", ""ptts"", ""pat"", ""patients (bv"", ""women. bv"", ""women. pv"", ""donor pv"", ""patient, variant"", ""human subspecies"", ""d+/r"", ""patients). pv"", ""patients; variant"", ""patient pv"", ""p"", ""patients), str"", ""pn"", ""hand dystonia"", ""dystonias"", ""focal dystonia"", ""dystonia"", ""fhd"", ""benign essential blepharospasm"", ""dystonic symptoms"", ""cervical dystonia"", ""dyt1"", ""focal hand dystonia""]"
"""33468570""","""Disease Modeling with Human Neurons Reveals LMNB1 Dysregulation Underlying DYT1 Dystonia.""","""DYT1 dystonia is a hereditary neurologic movement disorder characterized by uncontrollable muscle contractions. It is caused by a heterozygous mutation in <i>Torsin A</i> (<i>TOR1A</i>), a gene encoding a membrane-embedded ATPase. While animal models provide insights into disease mechanisms, significant species-dependent differences exist since animals with the identical heterozygous mutation fail to show pathology. Here, we model DYT1 by using human patient-specific cholinergic motor neurons (MNs) that are generated through either direct conversion of patients' skin fibroblasts or differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). These human MNs with the heterozygous <i>TOR1A</i> mutation show reduced neurite length and branches, markedly thickened nuclear lamina, disrupted nuclear morphology, and impaired nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT) of mRNAs and proteins, whereas they lack the perinuclear \""blebs\"" that are often observed in animal models. Furthermore, we uncover that the nuclear lamina protein LMNB1 is upregulated in DYT1 cells and exhibits abnormal subcellular distribution in a cholinergic MNs-specific manner. Such dysregulation of LMNB1 can be recapitulated by either ectopic expression of the mutant <i>TOR1A</i> gene or shRNA-mediated downregulation of endogenous <i>TOR1A</i> in healthy control MNs. Interestingly, downregulation of LMNB1 can largely ameliorate all the cellular defects in DYT1 MNs. These results reveal the value of disease modeling with human patient-specific neurons and indicate that dysregulation of LMNB1, a crucial component of the nuclear lamina, may constitute a major molecular mechanism underlying DYT1 pathology.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Inaccessibility to patient neurons greatly impedes our understanding of the pathologic mechanisms for dystonia. In this study, we employ reprogrammed human patient-specific motor neurons (MNs) to model DYT1, the most severe hereditary form of dystonia. Our results reveal disease-dependent deficits in nuclear morphology and nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT). Most importantly, we further identify LMNB1 dysregulation as a major contributor to these deficits, uncovering a new pathologic mechanism for DYT1 dystonia.""","""2021""","[""tor1a"", ""dystonia"", ""human"", ""patients"", ""patient"", ""infant"", ""mammalian"", ""infants"", ""boy"", ""child"", ""woman"", ""humans"", ""children"", ""girl"", ""mammal"", ""boys"", ""participants"", ""women"", ""man"", ""donor"", ""persons"", ""men"", ""person"", ""people"", ""girls"", ""peoples"", ""participant"", ""outpatient"", ""donor variant"", ""patient variant"", ""mammalians"", ""homo sapiens"", ""pt"", ""homo sapiens linnaeus, 1758"", ""pts"", ""h. sapiens"", ""humans. subsp"", ""human pv"", ""hs"", ""mans"", ""patients. variant"", ""patients. str"", ""pats"", ""patients' variant"", ""mammalia"", ""children. pv"", ""p=ns"", ""human variant"", ""pns"", ""ch"", ""hsa"", ""patients, bv"", ""op"", ""child."", ""patients, pv"", ""patients."", ""patients,"", ""patients. pv"", ""para"", ""patients; str"", ""p = ns"", ""p =ns"", ""pten"", ""human bv"", ""ppl"", ""patients (variant"", ""humans, variant"", ""hu"", ""patients (pv"", ""patients pv"", ""humans, bv"", ""human biovar"", ""ptts"", ""pat"", ""patients (bv"", ""women. bv"", ""women. pv"", ""donor pv"", ""patient, variant"", ""human subspecies"", ""d+/r"", ""patients). pv"", ""patients; variant"", ""patient pv"", ""p"", ""patients), str"", ""pn"", ""neurological movement disorder"", ""torsin a"", ""dyt1"", ""lmnb1""]"

The coding substitutions were: c. 238A>G (p.Ile80Val), found in two patients, and c.167A>G (p.Glu56Gly), found in one patient. The same variations were present also in the patients' symptomatic as well as asymptomatic relatives. Mutation penetration in the analyzed families was 50-66.7%. In the fourth patient, a novel c.-249C>A substitution in the promoter region was identified. The patient, initially suspected of idiopathic isolated dystonia, finally presented with pantothenate kinase 2-associated neurodegeneration phenotype and was a carrier of two PANK2 mutations. This is the first identified NBIA1 case carrying mutations in both PANK2 and THAP1 genes. In all symptomatic THAP1 mutation carriers (four probands and their three affected relatives) the first signs of dystonia occurred before the age of 23. A primary localization typical for DYT6 dystonia was observed in six individuals. Five subjects developed the first signs of dystonia in the upper limb. In one patient the disease began from laryngeal involvement. An uncommon primary involvement of lower limb was noted in the THAP1 and PANK2 mutations carrier.

Methods.  A MEDLINE search identified 137 patients who underwent DBS for dystonia in 24 studies that had individual BFM scores. Individual patient data, including age at onset of dystonia, age at surgery, gender, distribution of dystonia, etiology of dystonia, presence of associated features, abnormality of preoperative imaging, prior stereotactic surgeries, nucleus stimulated, type of anesthesia used, use of physiologic monitoring, type of imaging used for localization, stimulation parameters used, time of response to stimulation, and timing of outcome assessment were entered into an SPSS database for statistical analysis. Results.  The mean BFM percentage change (improvement in postoperative score from baseline) was 51.8% (range -34% to 100%). Significantly better outcomes were achieved with stimulation of the globus pallidus internus (GPi) than with stimulation of the posterior portion of the ventral lateral (VLp) nucleus of the thalamus (p = 0.0001). The etiology of the dystonia also had a significant effect on outcomes. Statistically significant improvements in outcomes were seen for all etiologic categories, except encephalitis.

Intrafamilial, age-related, phenotypic heterogeneity was noted in 14 PTD families. The authors hypothesized that the clinical presentation of PTD was modulated by the age at onset of the dystonia, irrespective of the genotype.<h4>Methods</h4>This hypothesis was addressed in a study of 14 PTD families and a meta-analysis of 83 published series of PTD.<h4>Results</h4>In 12 families with adult-onset PTD, the index cases presented with cervical dystonia (CD); of the 22 affected relatives, 17 had CD, 2 had writer's cramp, 1 had blepharospasm, and 2 had spasmodic dysphonia. In the two other PTD families, the probands and all 10 symptomatic relatives had limb-onset dystonia at <20 years of age. There were differences between the median ages at onset of the different phenotypes (p = 0.0037). Analysis of 83 published series including 5,057 patients indicated significant differences in the mean age at onset of five phenotypes of PTD (mean age at onset; 95% CI): DYT1 dystonia (11.3 years; 10.3 to 12.2), writer's cramp (38.4; 36.9 to 39.9), CD (40.8; 40.3 to 41.3), spasmodic dysphonia (43.0; 42.2 to 43.9), and blepharospasm-oromandibular dystonia (55.7; 55.1 to 56.4).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Phenotypic variation in PTD presentation is due to the effect of age at onset modulating the expression of a genetic disorder with a caudal-to-rostral change in the site of onset.""","""2004""","[""primary torsion dystonia"", ""blepharospasm"", ""human"", ""patients"", ""patient"", ""infant"", ""mammalian"", ""infants"", ""boy"", ""child"", ""woman"", ""humans"", ""children"", ""girl"", ""mammal"", ""boys"", ""participants"", ""women"", ""man"", ""donor"", ""persons"", ""men"", ""person"", ""people"", ""girls"", ""peoples"", ""participant"", ""outpatient"", ""donor variant"", ""patient variant"", ""mammalians"", ""homo sapiens"", ""pt"", ""homo sapiens linnaeus, 1758"", ""pts"", ""h. sapiens"", ""humans. subsp"", ""human pv"", ""hs"", ""mans"", ""patients. variant"", ""patients. str"", ""pats"", ""patients' variant"", ""mammalia"", ""children. pv"", ""p=ns"", ""human variant"", ""pns"", ""ch"", ""hsa"", ""patients, bv"", ""op"", ""child."", ""patients, pv"", ""patients."", ""patients,"", ""patients. pv"", ""para"", ""patients; str"", ""p = ns"", ""p =ns"", ""pten"", ""human bv"", ""ppl"", ""patients (variant"", ""humans, variant"", ""hu"", ""patients (pv"", ""patients pv"", ""humans, bv"", ""human biovar"", ""ptts"", ""pat"", ""patients (bv"", ""women. bv"", ""women. pv"", ""donor pv"", ""patient, variant"", ""human subspecies"", ""d+/r"", ""patients). pv"", ""patients; variant"", ""patient pv"", ""p"", ""patients), str"", ""pn"", ""genetic disorder"", ""dyt1"", ""ptd"", ""spasmodic dysphonia"", ""limb-onset dystonia"", ""blepharospasm-oromandibular dystonia"", ""cervical dystonia"", ""dystonia"", ""torsion dystonia""]"
"""12652041""","""Deep brain stimulation for dystonia in adults. Overview and developments.""","""The renaissance of functional neurosurgery in the treatment of Parkinson's disease has sparked also the interest in other movement disorders which are refractory to medical treatment. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been used only since a few years in dystonia patients. This review summarizes the available data on pallidal and thalamic DBS for various dystonic syndromes. The major advantage of DBS as compared to radiofrequency lesioning is that it allows performing contemporaneous bilateral surgery with relatively low morbidity in these patients. The posteroventral lateral globus pallidus internus (GPi) has been the preferred target in most instances, thus far. While phasic dystonic movements may improve early after surgery, the response of tonic dystonic movements to chronic stimulation may be delayed. The most beneficial results have been achieved in patients with primary genetic generalized and segmental dystonia, myoclonic dystonia, and complex cervical dystonia. Outcome has been varied in patients with other dystonic disorders, in particular those with secondary dystonia. Most studies have reported on relatively short follow-up periods, on single cases, or were retrospective. Pallidal DBS has been shown to be effective in complex cervical dystonia yielding both symptomatic and functional benefit for up to 2.5 years of follow-up. Dramatic improvement has been obtained in children and in adults with DYT1 positive dystonia. Also, patients with non DYT1 genetic dystonia achieved sustained benefit for up to 2 years of follow-up. Preliminary experience indicates that choreoathetosis in patients with cerebral palsy responds less well to pallidal DBS, and that it may not be effective at all in some patients. In single instances unilateral pallidal DBS has been shown to yield valuable benefit in patients with hemidystonia. The experience with DBS for treatment of Meige syndrome and other focal dystonias has been explored only recently. There is much less experience with thalamic DBS for dystonia. Thalamic DBS has been shown to be effective in single cases with posttraumatic dystonia, postanoxic dystonia and paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dystonia. Future perspectives of DBS for treatment of dystonia include the development of new technology, the evaluation of the possible role of other targets, and carefully planned studies to further establish the role of surgery.""","""2002""","[""myoclonic dystonia"", ""movement disorders"", ""human"", ""patients"", ""patient"", ""infant"", ""mammalian"", ""infants"", ""boy"", ""child"", ""woman"", ""humans"", ""children"", ""girl"", ""mammal"", ""boys"", ""participants"", ""women"", ""man"", ""donor"", ""persons"", ""men"", ""person"", ""people"", ""girls"", ""peoples"", ""participant"", ""outpatient"", ""donor variant"", ""patient variant"", ""mammalians"", ""homo sapiens"", ""pt"", ""homo sapiens linnaeus, 1758"", ""pts"", ""h. sapiens"", ""humans. subsp"", ""human pv"", ""hs"", ""mans"", ""patients. variant"", ""patients. str"", ""pats"", ""patients' variant"", ""mammalia"", ""children. pv"", ""p=ns"", ""human variant"", ""pns"", ""ch"", ""hsa"", ""patients, bv"", ""op"", ""child."", ""patients, pv"", ""patients."", ""patients,"", ""patients. pv"", ""para"", ""patients; str"", ""p = ns"", ""p =ns"", ""pten"", ""human bv"", ""ppl"", ""patients (variant"", ""humans, variant"", ""hu"", ""patients (pv"", ""patients pv"", ""humans, bv"", ""human biovar"", ""ptts"", ""pat"", ""patients (bv"", ""women. bv"", ""women. pv"", ""donor pv"", ""patient, variant"", ""human subspecies"", ""d+/r"", ""patients). pv"", ""patients; variant"", ""patient pv"", ""p"", ""patients), str"", ""pn"", ""paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dystonia"", ""choreoathetosis"", ""dystonic syndromes"", ""tonic dystonic"", ""dystonic disorders"", ""dystonia"", ""meige syndrome"", ""parkinson's disease"", ""dystonias"", ""dystonic movements"", ""dyt1"", ""cerebral palsy"", ""hemidystonia"", ""posttraumatic dystonia""]"

Additionally, reports of linkage disequilibrium between several chromosome 18 markers and focal dystonia, both in sporadic patients from northern Germany and in members of affected families from central Europe suggest the existence of a founder mutation underlying focal dystonia in this population. To evaluate the role of these loci in focal dystonia, we tested 85 patients from northern Germany who had primary focal dystonia, both for the GAG deletion in the DYT1 gene on chromosome 9q34 and for linkage disequilibrium at the chromosome 18p markers D18S1105, D18S1098, D18S481, and D18S54. None of these patients had the GAG deletion in the DYT1 gene. Furthermore, Hardy-Weinberg analysis of markers on 18p in our patient population and in 85 control subjects from the same region did not support linkage disequilibrium. Taken together, these results suggest that most cases of focal dystonia in patients of northern German or central European origin are due neither to the GAG deletion in DYT1 nor to a proposed founder mutation on chromosome 18p but must be caused by other genetic or environmental factors.""","""1998""","[""human"", ""patients"", ""patient"", ""infant"", ""mammalian"", ""infants"", ""boy"", ""child"", ""woman"", ""humans"", ""children"", ""girl"", ""mammal"", ""boys"", ""participants"", ""women"", ""man"", ""donor"", ""persons"", ""men"", ""person"", ""people"", ""girls"", ""peoples"", ""participant"", ""outpatient"", ""donor variant"", ""patient variant"", ""mammalians"", ""homo sapiens"", ""pt"", ""homo sapiens linnaeus, 1758"", ""pts"", ""h. sapiens"", ""humans. subsp"", ""human pv"", ""hs"", ""mans"", ""patients. variant"", ""patients. str"", ""pats"", ""patients' variant"", ""mammalia"", ""children. pv"", ""p=ns"", ""human variant"", ""pns"", ""ch"", ""hsa"", ""patients, bv"", ""op"", ""child."", ""patients, pv"", ""patients."", ""patients,"", ""patients. pv"", ""para"", ""patients; str"", ""p = ns"", ""p =ns"", ""pten"", ""human bv"", ""ppl"", ""patients (variant"", ""humans, variant"", ""hu"", ""patients (pv"", ""patients pv"", ""humans, bv"", ""human biovar"", ""ptts"", ""pat"", ""patients (bv"", ""women. bv"", ""women. pv"", ""donor pv"", ""patient, variant"", ""human subspecies"", ""d+/r"", ""patients). pv"", ""patients; variant"", ""patient pv"", ""p"", ""patients), str"", ""pn"", ""dystonia"", ""dyt7"", ""dyt1"", ""gag"", ""gag+"", ""torsion dystonia"", ""focal dystonia"", ""focal dystonias""]"
"""20301587""","""SGCE Myoclonus-Dystonia""","""<h4>Clinical characteristics</h4>SGCE myoclonus-dystonia (SGCE-M-D) is a movement disorder characterized by a combination of rapid, brief muscle contractions (myoclonus) and/or sustained twisting and repetitive movements that result in abnormal postures (dystonia). The myoclonic jerks typical of SGCE-M-D most often affect the neck, trunk, and upper limbs with less common involvement of the legs. Approximately 50% of affected individuals have additional focal or segmental dystonia, presenting as cervical dystonia and/or writer's cramp. Non-motor features may include alcohol abuse, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and anxiety disorders. Symptom onset is usually in the first decade of life and almost always by age 20 years, but ranges from age six months to 80 years. Most affected adults report a dramatic reduction in myoclonus in response to alcohol ingestion. SGCE-M-D is compatible with an active life of normal span.<h4>Diagnosis/testing</h4>The diagnosis of SGCE-M-D is established in a proband with characteristic clinical features by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in SGCE.<h4>Management</h4>Treatment of manifestations: Class 1 evidence supports the improvement of myoclonus and dystonia with zonisamide. Benzodiazepines (particularly clonazepam) and antiepileptics used to treat myoclonus (especially valproate and levitiracetam) also improve myoclonus in individuals with myoclonus-dystonia. The response to other antiepileptics (e.g., topiramate) is more variable. Anticholinergic medication may improve dystonia. Botulinum toxin injection may be especially helpful for cervical dystonia. Improvement with L-5-hydroxytryptophan, L-dopa, and the salt of sodium oxybate has been reported. Deep brain stimulation has improved both myoclonus and dystonia, with most targeting the globus pallidus interna (GPi); however, success with ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus (VIM) target has also been reported. Other: Symptoms of SGCE-M-D often improve short term with ingestion of alcohol, but the risk of addiction recommends against its long-term use.<h4>Genetic counseling</h4>SGCE-M-D is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner with penetrance determined by the parental origin of the altered SGCE allele: an SGCE pathogenic variant on the paternally derived (expressed) SGCE allele generally results in disease; a pathogenic variant on the maternally derived (silenced) SGCE allele typically does not result in disease. Most individuals with SGCE-M-D inherited the disorder from a heterozygous parent who may or may not have clinical signs of M-D (as phenotypic expression in the parent would depend on the gender of the transmitting grandparent). Each child of an individual with SGCE-M-D has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Almost all children who inherit an SGCE pathogenic variant from their father develop symptoms, whereas only ~5% of children who inherit an SGCE pathogenic variant from their mother develop symptoms. Once the SGCE pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing and preimplantation genetic diagnosis are possible.""","""2020""","[""vim"", ""obsessive-compulsive disorder"", ""benzodiazepines"", ""clonazepam"", ""tremor"", ""human"", ""patients"", ""patient"", ""infant"", ""mammalian"", ""infants"", ""boy"", ""child"", ""woman"", ""humans"", ""children"", ""girl"", ""mammal"", ""boys"", ""participants"", ""women"", ""man"", ""donor"", ""persons"", ""men"", ""person"", ""people"", ""girls"", ""peoples"", ""participant"", ""outpatient"", ""donor variant"", ""patient variant"", ""mammalians"", ""homo sapiens"", ""pt"", ""homo sapiens linnaeus, 1758"", ""pts"", ""h. sapiens"", ""humans. subsp"", ""human pv"", ""hs"", ""mans"", ""patients. variant"", ""patients. str"", ""pats"", ""patients' variant"", ""mammalia"", ""children. pv"", ""p=ns"", ""human variant"", ""pns"", ""ch"", ""hsa"", ""patients, bv"", ""op"", ""child."", ""patients, pv"", ""patients."", ""patients,"", ""patients. pv"", ""para"", ""patients; str"", ""p = ns"", ""p =ns"", ""pten"", ""human bv"", ""ppl"", ""patients (variant"", ""humans, variant"", ""hu"", ""patients (pv"", ""patients pv"", ""humans, bv"", ""human biovar"", ""ptts"", ""pat"", ""patients (bv"", ""women. bv"", ""women. pv"", ""donor pv"", ""patient, variant"", ""human subspecies"", ""d+/r"", ""patients). pv"", ""patients; variant"", ""patient pv"", ""p"", ""patients), str"", ""pn"", ""dyt1"", ""myoclonic jerks"", ""panic attacks"", ""hemiparesis"", ""alcohol abuse"", ""movement disorder"", ""dystonia"", ""anxiety"", ""depression"", ""l-5-hydroxytryptophan"", ""myoclonus"", ""inherited the disorder"", ""personality disorders"", ""dysarthria"", ""sodium oxybate"", ""ocd"", ""topiramate"", ""cervical dystonia"", ""valproate"", ""l-dopa"", ""neurologic deficits"", ""sgce"", ""myoclonus-dystonia"", ""alcohol"", ""drd2""]"

Electrodes were implanted bilaterally in the globus pallidus internus (GPi) using the Neuromate robot without the stereotactic frame. The authors calculated the distances between the electrodes and their respective planned trajectories, merging the postoperative CT with the preoperative plan using VoXim software. Clinical outcome was monitored using validated scales for dystonia and myoclonus preoperatively and at 1 month and 6 months postoperatively and by means of a quality-of-life questionnaire for children, administered before surgery and at 6 months' follow-up. We also recorded complications derived from the implantation technique, \""hardware,\"" and stimulation.<h4>Results</h4>Six patients aged 7 to 16 years and diagnosed with isolated dystonia ( DYT1 negative) (3 patients), choreo-dystonia related to PDE2A mutation (1 patient), or myoclonus-dystonia syndrome SGCE mutations (2 patients) were evaluated during a period of 6 to 19 months. The average accuracy in the placement of the electrodes was 1.24 mm at the target point. At the 6-month follow-up, patients showed an improvement in the motor (65%) and functional (48%) components of the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale. Patients with myoclonus and SGCE mutations also showed an improvement in action myoclonus (95%-100%) and in functional tests (50%-75%) according to the Unified Motor-Rating Scale. The Neuro-QOL score revealed inconsistent results, with improvement in motor function and social relationships but worsening in anxiety, cognitive function, and pain.

Broadening of phenotype of some of the previously described hereditary dystonias and environmental risk factors and trends in treatment will be covered.<h4>Recent findings</h4>Based on phenomenology, a new consensus update on the definition, phenomenology and classification of dystonia and a syndromic approach to guide diagnosis have been proposed. Terminology has changed and 'isolated dystonia' is used wherein dystonia is the only motor feature apart from tremor, and the previously called heredodegenerative dystonias and dystonia plus syndromes are now subsumed under 'combined dystonia'. The recently discovered genes ANO3, GNAL and CIZ1 appear not to be a common cause of adult-onset cervical dystonia. Clinical and genetic heterogeneity underlie myoclonus-dystonia, dopa-responsive dystonia and deafness-dystonia syndrome. ALS2 gene mutations are a newly recognized cause for combined dystonia. The phenotypic and genotypic spectra of ATP1A3 mutations have considerably broadened. Two new genome-wide association studies identified new candidate genes. A retrospective analysis suggested complicated vaginal delivery as a modifying risk factor in DYT1. Recent studies confirm lasting therapeutic effects of deep brain stimulation in isolated dystonia, good treatment response in myoclonus-dystonia, and suggest that early treatment correlates with a better outcome.<h4>Summary</h4>Phenotypic classification continues to be important to recognize particular forms of dystonia and this includes syndromic associations. There are a number of genes underlying isolated or combined dystonia and there will be further new discoveries with the advances in genetic technologies such as exome and whole-genome sequencing. The identification of new genes will facilitate better elucidation of pathogenetic mechanisms and possible corrective therapies.""","""2014""","[""als2"", ""atp1a3"", ""tremor"", ""isolated dystonia"", ""dystonia plus syndromes"", ""myoclonus-dystonia"", ""dystonia"", ""deafness-dystonia syndrome"", ""dopa-responsive dystonia"", ""hereditary dystonias"", ""ano3"", ""gnal"", ""dystonias"", ""ciz1"", ""cervical dystonia"", ""dyt1""]"

A proportion of cases are due to mutations in the maternally imprinted SGCE gene. We assembled the largest cohort of MDS patients to date, and determined the frequency and type of SGCE mutations. The aim was to establish the motor phenotype in mutation carriers and utility of current diagnostic criteria. Eighty-nine probands with clinical features compatible with MDS were recruited from the UK and Ireland. Patients were phenotypically classified as \""definite\"", \""probable\"" or \""possible\"" MDS according to previous guidelines. SGCE was analyzed using direct sequencing and copy number variant analysis. In those where no mutation was found, DYT1 (GAG deletion), GCH1, THAP1 and NKX2.1 genes were also sequenced. Nineteen (21.3%) probands had an SGCE mutation. Three patterns of motor symptoms emerged: (1) early childhood onset upper body myoclonus and dystonia, (2) early childhood onset lower limb dystonia, progressing later to more pronounced myoclonus and upper body involvement, and (3) later childhood onset upper body myoclonus and dystonia with evident cervical involvement.

Two dystonia patients from a single family with double mutations in DYT1 and SGCE exhibited more severe symptoms. A recent study suggested that torsinA contributes to the quality control of ε-sarcoglycan. Here, we derived mice carrying mutations in both Dyt1 and Sgce and found that these double mutant mice showed earlier onset of motor deficits in beam-walking test. A novel monoclonal antibody against mouse ε-sarcoglycan was developed by using Sgce knock-out mice to avoid the immune tolerance.

Although the exact function of torsinA remains elusive, evidence suggests aberrant localization and interaction of mutated protein; this may result in an abnormal response to stress or interference with cytoskeletal events and the development of neuronal brain pathways. Identification of DYT1 has also permitted studies of both \""manifesting\"" and \""non-manifesting\""DYT1 mutation carriers. These investigations have expanded our understanding of clinical expression to include psychiatric symptoms and also have enabled imaging studies of endophenotypes. Similarly, there has been progress in our understanding of the genetic underpinnings of the \""dystonia-plus\"" syndromes: dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD), myoclonus-dystonia (M-D), and rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism (RDP).

It is caused mainly by a heterozygous trinucleotide deletion in DYT1/TOR1A, coding for torsinA. The mutation may lead to a partial loss of torsinA function. Functional alterations of the basal ganglia circuits have been implicated in this disease. Striatal dopamine receptor 2 (D2R) levels are significantly decreased in DYT1 dystonia patients and in the animal models of DYT1 dystonia. D2R-expressing cells, such as the medium spiny neurons in the indirect pathway, striatal cholinergic interneurons, and dopaminergic neurons in the basal ganglia circuits, contribute to motor performance. However, the function of torsinA in these neurons and its contribution to the motor symptoms is not clear. Here, D2R-expressing-cell-specific Dyt1 conditional knockout (d2KO) mice were generated and in vivo effects of torsinA loss in the corresponding cells were examined. The Dyt1 d2KO mice showed significant reductions of striatal torsinA, acetylcholine metabolic enzymes, Tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA), and cholinergic interneurons. The Dyt1 d2KO mice also showed significant reductions of striatal D2R dimers and tyrosine hydroxylase without significant alteration in striatal monoamine contents or the number of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. The Dyt1 d2KO male mice showed motor deficits in the accelerated rotarod and beam-walking tests without overt dystonic symptoms. Moreover, the Dyt1 d2KO male mice showed significant correlations between striatal monoamines and locomotion.

Here, we explore the hypothesis that deficits in torsinA function result in an increased vulnerability to stress associated with protein folding and processing in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where torsinA is located. Using an in vivo quantitative readout for the ER stress response, we evaluated the consequences of torsinA mutations in transgenic nematodes expressing variants of human torsinA. This analysis revealed that, normally, torsinA serves a protective function to maintain a homeostatic threshold against ER stress. Furthermore, we show that the buffering capacity of torsinA is greatly diminished by the DYT1-associated deletion or mutations that prevent its translocation to the ER, block ATPase activity, or increase the levels of torsinA in the nuclear envelope versus ER. Combinations of transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans designed to mimic clinically relevant genetic modifiers of disease susceptibility also exhibit a direct functional correlation to changes in the ER stress response. Furthermore, using mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from torsinA knockout mice, we demonstrated that loss of endogenous torsinA results in enhanced sensitivity to ER stress.

Early-onset torsion dystonia (EOTD) is one such disorder characterized by sustained and involuntary muscle contractions that frequently cause repetitive movements or abnormal postures. Transmitted in an autosomal dominant manner with reduced penetrance, EOTD is caused in most cases by the deletion of a glutamic acid (DeltaE) in the DYT1 (also known as TOR1A) gene product, torsinA. Although some patients respond well to anticholingerics, therapy is primarily limited to either neurosurgery or chemodenervation. As mutant torsinA (DeltaE) expression results in decreased torsinA function, therapeutic strategies directed toward enhancement of wild-type (WT) torsinA activity in patients who are heterozygous for mutant DYT1 may restore normal cellular functionality. Here, we report results from the first-ever screen for candidate small molecule therapeutics for EOTD, using multiple activity-based readouts for torsinA function in Caenorhabditis elegans, subsequent validation in human DYT1 patient fibroblasts, and behavioral rescue in a mouse model of DYT1 dystonia. We exploited the nematode to rapidly discern chemical effectors of torsinA and identified two classes of antibiotics, quinolones and aminopenicillins, which enhance WT torsinA activity in two separate in vivo assays. Representative molecules were assayed in EOTD patient fibroblasts for improvements in torsinA-dependent secretory function, which was improved significantly by ampicillin. Furthermore, a behavioral defect associated with an EOTD mouse knock-in model was also rescued following administration of ampicillin.

We previously examined the effect of the human mutant torsinA on striatal dopaminergic function in a conventional transgenic mouse model of DYT1 dystonia (hMT1), in which human mutant torsinA is expressed under the cytomegalovirus promotor. Systemic administration of amphetamine did not increase dopamine (DA) release as efficiently in these mice as compared with wild-type transgenic and non-transgenic mice. We, now, studied the contribution of the DA transporter (DAT) to amphetamine-induced DA release in hMT1 transgenic mice using in vivo no-net flux microdialysis. This method applies different concentrations of DA through the microdialysis probe and measures DA concentration at the output of the probe following an equilibrium period. The slope (extraction fraction) is the measure of the DAT activity in vivo. The slope for hMT1 transgenic mice was 0.58 +/- 0.07 and for non-transgenic animals, 0.87 +/- 0.06 (p < 0.05). We further investigated the efficacy of nomifensine (a specific DAT inhibitor) in inhibiting amphetamine-induced DA release. Local application of nomifensine 80 min before the systemic application of amphetamine inhibited DA release in both transgenic mice and their non-transgenic littermates. The efficiency of the inhibition appeared to be different, with mean values of 48% for hMT1 transgenic mice versus 84% for non-transgenic littermates. Moreover, we have evaluated basal and amphetamine-induced locomotion in hMT1 transgenic mice compared with their non-transgenic littermates, using an O-maze behavioral chamber. Basal levels of locomotion in the hMT1 transgenic mice showed that they moved much less than their non-transgenic littermates (0.9 +/- 0.3 m for transgenic mice vs. 2.4 +/- 0.7 m for non-transgenic littermates, p < 0.05). This relative reduction in locomotion was also observed following amphetamine administration (48.5 +/- 6.7 m for transgenics vs. 73.7 +/- 9.8 m for non-transgenics, p < 0.05). These results support the finding that there are altered dynamics of DA release and reuptake in hMT1 transgenic mice in vivo, with DAT activity is reduced in the presence of mutant torsinA, which is consistent with behavioral consequences such as reduced locomotion and (previously described) abnormal motor phenotypes such as increased hind-base width and impaired performance on the raised-beam task.

To elucidate the relevance of these GABAergic interneurons in the pathophysiology of DYT1 dystonia, we used in vivo optogenetics to specifically inhibit Parv+ and to detect changes in motor behavior and neuronal activity. Optogenetic fibers were bilaterally implanted into the dorsal striatum of male DYT1 KI mice and wild-type (WT) littermates expressing halorhodopsin (eNpHR3.0) in Parv+ interneurons. While stimulations with yellow light pulses for up to 60 min at different pulse durations and interval lengths did not induce abnormal movements, such as dystonic signs, immunohistochemical examinations revealed genotype-dependent differences. In contrast to WT mice, stimulated DYT1 KI showed decreased striatal neuronal activity, that is, less c-Fos reactive neurons, and increased activation of cholinergic interneurons after optogenetic inhibition of Parv+ interneurons. These findings suggest an involvement of Parv+ interneurons in an impaired striatal network in DYT1 KI mice, but at least short-term inhibition of these GABAergic interneurons is not sufficient to trigger a dystonic phenotype, similar to previously shown optogenetic activation of cholinergic interneurons.""","""2022""","[""parv"", ""c-fos"", ""dystonic"", ""parvalbumin"", ""dyt1"", ""mice"", ""torsion dystonia"", ""tor1a"", ""human"", ""dystonia"", ""subtle sensorimotor deficits""]"

Previous studies have shown increased acetylcholine levels in the striatum of DYT1 knock-in (KI) mice. Ex vivo data indicated that muscarinic receptor antagonists normalize the activity of striatal cholinergic interneurons. Currently receptor subtype specific antagonists are developed for therapy, however, it is yet unknown whether the levels of targeted receptors are unaltered. In the present study, we firstly examined the expression of M1 and M4 receptors in DYT1 KI mice in comparison to wildtype mice. While no changes in mRNA were found in the motor cortex, the expression of M1 was higher in the striatum of DYT1 KI. However, M1 protein did not differ in striatum and cortex between the animal groups as shown by immunohistochemistry and western blot. M4 receptor protein, unaltered in the cortex, was slightly lower in lateral subparts of the striatum, but unchanged in somata of cholinergic interneurons and substance P immunoreactive projection neurons. Functional alterations of the cholinergic system and of aberrant striatal plasticity, demonstrated by previous studies, seem not to be related to overt changes in M1 and M4 expression.

Three forms of isolated human dystonia result from mutations in the <i>TOR1A</i> (DYT1), <i>THAP1</i> (DYT6), and <i>GNAL</i> (DYT25) genes. Experimental models carrying these mutations facilitate identification of possible shared cellular mechanisms. Recently, we reported elevated extracellular striatal acetylcholine by <i>in vivo</i> microdialysis and paradoxical excitation of cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) by dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) agonism using <i>ex vivo</i> slice electrophysiology in <i>Dyt1</i> <sup>ΔGAG/+</sup> mice. The paradoxical excitation was caused by overactive muscarinic receptors (mAChRs), leading to a switch in D2R coupling from canonical G<sub>i/o</sub> to noncanonical β-arrestin signaling. We sought to determine whether these mechanisms in <i>Dyt1</i> <sup>ΔGAG/+</sup> mice are shared with <i>Thap1</i> <sup>C54Y/+</sup> knock-in and <i>Gnal</i> <sup>+/-</sup> knock-out dystonia models and to determine the impact of sex. We found <i>Thap1</i> <sup>C54Y/+</sup> mice of both sexes have elevated extracellular striatal acetylcholine and D2R-induced paradoxical ChI excitation, which was reversed by mAChR inhibition. Elevated extracellular acetylcholine was absent in male and female <i>Gnal</i> <sup>+/-</sup> mice, but the paradoxical D2R-mediated ChI excitation was retained and only reversed by inhibition of adenosine A2ARs. The G<sub>i/o</sub>-preferring D2R agonist failed to increase ChI excitability, suggesting a possible switch in coupling of D2Rs to β-arrestin, as seen previously in a DYT1 model. These data show that, whereas elevated extracellular acetylcholine levels are not always detected across these genetic models of human dystonia, the D2R-mediated paradoxical excitation of ChIs is shared and is caused by altered function of distinct G-protein-coupled receptors.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Dystonia is a common and often disabling movement disorder. The usual medical treatment of dystonia is pharmacotherapy with nonselective antagonists of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, which have many undesirable side effects. Development of new therapeutics is a top priority for dystonia research. The current findings, considered in context with our previous investigations, establish a role for cholinergic dysfunction across three mouse models of human genetic dystonia: DYT1, DYT6, and DYT25.

It is caused by a three base-pair deletion (ΔGAG) in the gene encoding the AAA(+) protein torsinA, which gives rise to a loss of function mutation responsible of neuronal functional abnormalities. Symptoms typically appear during childhood, suggesting the presence of an early critical period of sensorimotor circuit susceptibility to torsinA dysfunction. Here, we identified in two different DYT1 mouse strains, heterozygous torsinA knockout mice (Tor1a+/-) and human ΔGAG mutant torsinA transgenic mice (hMT), the anatomical abnormalities in the cerebellum, during a critical age for synaptogenesis (postnatal day 14, P14). By means of immunofluorescence, confocal analysis and western blot quantification, we observed a reduced inhibitory input on Purkinje cells (PCs) as well as an unbalanced excitatory innervation; a significant reduction of the parallel fiber (PF) synaptic terminals and an increase of the climbing fiber (CF) inputs. Finally, in support of the in vivo results, we also provide evidence of an impaired PF synaptogenesis in a co-culture system. Of note, these alterations were rescued and in part over-compensated in the adult age in both mouse strains, suggesting that torsinA dysfunction can induce an altered maturation of cerebellar synaptic contacts. Altogether these results indicate that a loss of function of torsinA during cerebellar synaptogenesis induces important developmental alterations, that might contribute to the age-dependent susceptibility to develop dystonia in mutation carriers.""","""2015""","[""dyt1"", ""dystonia"", ""hmt"", ""human"", ""tor1a"", ""mice"", ""mouse"", ""torsina dysfunction"", ""neuronal functional abnormalities"", ""autosomal-dominant movement disorder"", ""torsion dystonia""]"

Evidence suggests that TOR1A mutation produces dystonia through an aberrant neuronal signalling within the striatum, where D2 dopamine receptors (D2R) produce an abnormal excitatory response in cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) in different models of DYT1 dystonia. The excitability of ChIs may be modulated by group I metabotropic glutamate receptor subtypes (mGlu1 and 5). We performed electrophysiological and calcium imaging recordings from ChIs of both knock-in mice heterozygous for Δ-torsinA (Tor1a(+/Δgag) mice) and transgenic mice overexpressing human torsinA (hMT1). We demonstrate that the novel negative allosteric modulator (NAM) of metabotropic glutamate 5 (mGlu) receptor, dipraglurant (ADX48621) counteracts the abnormal membrane responses and calcium rise induced either by the D2R agonist quinpirole or by caged dopamine (NPEC-Dopamine) in both models. These inhibitory effects were mimicked by two other well-characterized mGlu5 receptor antagonists, SIB1757 and MPEP, but not by mGlu1 antagonism. D2R and mGlu5 post-receptor signalling may converge on PI3K/Akt pathway. Interestingly, we found that the abnormal D2R response was prevented by the selective PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, whereas PLC and PKC inhibitors were both ineffective. Currently, no satisfactory pharmacological treatment is available for DYT1 dystonia patients. Our data show that negative modulation of mGlu5 receptors may counteract abnormal D2R responses, normalizing cholinergic cell excitability, by modulating the PI3K/Akt post-receptor pathway, thereby representing a novel potential treatment of DYT1 dystonia.""","""2014""","[""dyt1"", ""patients"", ""ly294002"", ""akt"", ""mpep"", ""sib1757"", ""dopamine"", ""npec"", ""quinpirole"", ""glutamate"", ""hmt1"", ""torsina"", ""human"", ""transgenic mice"", ""tor1a"", ""mice"", ""calcium"", ""dyt1 dystonia"", ""d2r"", ""d2 dopamine receptors"", ""dystonia"", ""autosomal dominantly inherited disorder"", ""d2 dopamine receptor"", ""torsion dystonia""]"

To date, a great deal of attention has been focused on neuronal TA since its mutant form causes early-onset (DYT1) torsion dystonia, an inherited movement disorder characterized by sustained muscle contractions and abnormal postures. Interestingly, it has been proposed that TA, by interacting with the cytoskeletal network, may contribute to the control of neurite outgrowth and/or by acting as a chaperone at synapses could affect synaptic vesicle turnover and neurotransmitter release. Accordingly, both its peculiar developmental expression in striatum and cerebellum and evidence from DYT1 knock-in mice suggest that TA may influence dendritic arborization and synaptogenesis in the brain. Therefore, to better understand TA function a detailed description of its localization at synaptic level is required. Here, we characterized by means of rigorous quantitative confocal analysis TA distribution in the mouse cerebellum at postnatal day 14 (P14), when both cerebellar synaptogenesis and TA expression peak. We observed that the protein is broadly distributed both in cerebellar cortex and in the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN). Of note, Purkinje cells (PC) express high levels of TA also in the spines and axonal terminals. In addition, abundant expression of the protein was found in the main GABA-ergic and glutamatergic inputs of the cerebellar cortex.

OBJECTIVES:We performed a critical review of this topic, outlining clinical features and linked genetic disorders to recognize subject at higher risk of SD, describing precipitant and trigger factors and proposing potential pharmacological treatment strategies in order to prevent hospitalization. RESULTS:Genetic predisposition included: primary dystonias particularly in the case of  TOR1A mutation; epileptic encephalopathy such as ARX and GNAO1 genetic variants and neurodegenerative disorders as PANK2. Early recognition of SD should be oriented by the following sign and symptoms: fever, tachycardia, respiratory change, hypertension, sweating and autonomic instability, elevated serum CK. Pain, fever and dehydration are main trigger factors that have to be prevented or quickly controlled. Achieving sleep could be the first therapeutic option in those with high risk of developing SD.

The previously reported examples of 9q33q34 microdeletion including STXBP1 are reviewed.<h4>Results</h4>The patient developed infantile spasms at 4 months of age, and these were refractory to multiple antiepileptic drugs. He also developed severe dystonia during infancy, rotatory nystagmus, and nephroureteral malformations. Immunoglobulin and clobazam administered at 11 months were effective for the spasms, but profound psychomotor retardation remained. A comparative genomic hybridization array analysis and the fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis revealed a de novo 2.0-Mb microdeletion in chromosome 9q33q34, which encompasses STXBP1, ENG, SPTAN1, and 52 other genes. A total of 14 patients (13 from the literature) with a 9q33q24 microdeletion including STXBP1 were reviewed, five of them displayed early infantile epileptic encephalopathy with suppression-burst, and six of them had early-onset epilepsy but not early infantile epileptic encephalopathy. Dystonia has been previously described in 9q33q34 deletions involving TOR1A but not STXBP1.

OBJECTIVE: To summarize current knowledge about movement disorders overrepresented among patients of Jewish ancestry. EVIDENCE REVIEW: We searched PubMed and the OMIM and Israeli National Genetic Databases for articles published from 1969 through March 31, 2014, using the search terms Parkinson's disease,movement disorders, ataxia, dystonia, chorea, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob with and Jewish. The final reference list was generated by giving priority to articles directly related to the topic, articles with the latest information, and comprehensive but relevant reviews. FINDINGS: About one-third of patients with sporadic Parkinson disease (PD) and more than 40% of patients with familial PD of Ashkenazi Jewish descent likely carry the G2019S mutation in the LRRK2 gene, a mutation in the glucocerebrosidase (GBA) gene, or both. This finding contrasts with only a 10% frequency of these mutations in patients with PD who are of non-Jewish ancestry. A dystonia due to a TOR1A gene mutation is responsible for most early-onset autosomal dominant dystonia, and 90% of Ashkenazi Jews who develop early-onset disease have TOR1A-related dystonia. Familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis tend to cluster among Jews of North African descent, and Machado-Joseph disease is particularly frequent in Yemenite Jews. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Genetic forms of PD are much more common in patients of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry with sporadic and familial PD than in the non-Jewish population.

We aimed to induce dystonia-like symptoms in male ∆ETorA rats by peripheral nerve injury and to identify central mechanism of dystonia development. Dystonia-like movements (DLM) were assessed using the tail suspension test and implementing a pipeline of deep learning applications. Neuron numbers of striatal parvalbumin<sup>+</sup>, nNOS<sup>+</sup>, calretinin<sup>+</sup>, ChAT<sup>+</sup> interneurons and Nissl<sup>+</sup> cells were estimated by unbiased stereology. Striatal dopaminergic metabolism was analyzed via in vivo microdialysis, qPCR and western blot. Local field potentials (LFP) were recorded from the central motor network. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the entopeduncular nucleus (EP) was performed. Nerve-injured ∆ETorA rats developed long-lasting DLM over 12 weeks. No changes in striatal structure were observed. Dystonic-like ∆ETorA rats presented a higher striatal dopaminergic turnover and stimulus-induced elevation of dopamine efflux compared to the control groups. Higher LFP theta power in the EP of dystonic-like ∆ETorA compared to wt rats was recorded. Chronic EP-DBS over 3 weeks led to improvement of DLM. Our data emphasizes the role of environmental factors in TOR1A symptomatogenesis. LFP analyses indicate that the pathologically enhanced theta power is a physiomarker of DLM. This TOR1A model replicates key features of the human TOR1A pathology on multiple biological levels and is therefore suited for further analysis of dystonia pathomechanism.""","""2021""","[""tor1a"", ""dystonia"", ""parvalbumin"", ""dopamine"", ""chat"", ""nnos"", ""nerve injury"", ""rats"", ""rat"", ""sprague-dawley rats"", ""wistar rats"", ""gunn rats"", ""sprague dawley rats"", ""laboratory rats"", ""laboratory rat"", ""brown rat"", ""rattus norvegicus"", ""r. norvegicus"", ""norway rats"", ""brown rats"", ""sprague-dawley rat"", ""sprague dawley rat"", ""sdrs"", ""sdr"", ""norway rat"", ""laboratory"", ""rn"", ""sprague-dawley rat substrain"", ""spd"", ""wistar-rats"", ""sprague - dawley rats"", ""sprague dawley  rat"", ""wistar stra"", ""sprague-dawley stra"", ""wistar) rats"", ""buffalo rat"", ""rat pv"", ""sd rats"", ""sprague"", ""b-/- rats"", ""wr"", ""buffalo rats"", ""buf rats"", ""zitter rats"", ""sprague dawley) rat"", ""sprague dawley stra"", ""sd"", ""sprague-dawley  rats"", ""sprague dawley  rats"", ""sprague -dawley rats"", ""sprague-dawley-rat"", ""sprague- dawley rats"", ""laboratory, rats"", ""r.n"", ""g. rats"", ""rat variant"", ""b - rats"", ""dystonic"", ""calretinin"", ""human"", ""patients"", ""patient"", ""infant"", ""mammalian"", ""infants"", ""boy"", ""child"", ""woman"", ""humans"", ""children"", ""girl"", ""mammal"", ""boys"", ""participants"", ""women"", ""man"", ""donor"", ""persons"", ""men"", ""person"", ""people"", ""girls"", ""peoples"", ""participant"", ""outpatient"", ""donor variant"", ""patient variant"", ""mammalians"", ""homo sapiens"", ""pt"", ""homo sapiens linnaeus, 1758"", ""pts"", ""h. sapiens"", ""humans. subsp"", ""human pv"", ""hs"", ""mans"", ""patients. variant"", ""patients. str"", ""pats"", ""patients' variant"", ""mammalia"", ""children. pv"", ""p=ns"", ""human variant"", ""pns"", ""ch"", ""hsa"", ""patients, bv"", ""op"", ""child."", ""patients, pv"", ""patients."", ""patients,"", ""patients. pv"", ""para"", ""patients; str"", ""p = ns"", ""p =ns"", ""pten"", ""human bv"", ""ppl"", ""patients (variant"", ""humans, variant"", ""hu"", ""patients (pv"", ""patients pv"", ""humans, bv"", ""human biovar"", ""ptts"", ""pat"", ""patients (bv"", ""women. bv"", ""women. pv"", ""donor pv"", ""patient, variant"", ""human subspecies"", ""d+/r"", ""patients). pv"", ""patients; variant"", ""patient pv"", ""p"", ""patients), str"", ""pn""]"

Despite being a first-line testing tool for heterogeneous inherited disorders, whole-exome sequencing has not yet been evaluated in dystonia diagnostics. We set up a pilot study to address the yield of whole-exome sequencing for early-onset generalized dystonia, a disease subtype enriched for monogenic causation.<h4>Methods</h4>Clinical whole-exome sequencing coupled with bioinformatics analysis and detailed phenotyping of mutation carriers was performed on 16 consecutive cases with genetically undefined early-onset generalized dystonia. Candidate pathogenic variants were validated and tested for cosegregation. The whole-exome approach was complemented by analyzing 2 mutated yet unestablished causative genes in another 590 dystonia cases.<h4>Results</h4>Whole-exome sequencing detected clinically relevant mutations of known dystonia-related genes in 6 generalized dystonia cases (37.5%), among whom 3 had novel variants. Reflecting locus heterogeneity, identified unique variants were distributed over 5 genes (GCH1, THAP1, TOR1A, ANO3, ADCY5), of which only 1 (ANO3) was mutated recurrently. Three genes (GCH1, THAP1, TOR1A) were associated with isolated generalized dystonia, whereas 2 (ANO3, ADCY5) gave rise to combined dystonia-myoclonus phenotypes. Follow-up screening of ANO3 and ADCY5 revealed a set of distinct variants of interest, the pathogenicity of which was supported by bioinformatics testing and cosegregation work.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our study identified whole-exome sequencing as an effective strategy for molecular diagnosis of early-onset generalized dystonia and offers insights into the heterogeneous genetic architecture of this condition. Furthermore, it provides confirmatory evidence for a dystonia-relevant role of ANO3 and ADCY5, both of which likely associate with a broader spectrum of dystonic expressions than previously thought. © 2016 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.""","""2016""","[""dystonia"", ""tor1a"", ""inherited disorders"", ""gch1"", ""parkinson and movement disorder"", ""dystonia-myoclonus"", ""thap1"", ""generalized dystonia"", ""adcy5"", ""ano3"", ""dystonic""]"

It followed MDSGene's standardized data extraction protocol and screened a total of ~1200 citations. Phenotypic and genotypic data on ~1200 patients with 254 different mutations were curated and analyzed. There were differences regarding age at onset, site of onset, and distribution of symptoms across mutation carriers in all 7 genes. Although carriers of TOR1A, THAP1, PRKRA, KMT2B, or HPCA mutations mostly showed childhood and adolescent onset, patients with GNAL and ANO3 mutations often developed first symptoms in adulthood. GNAL and KMT2B mutation carriers frequently have 1 predominant site of onset, that is, the neck (GNAL) or the lower limbs (KMT2B), whereas site of onset in DYT-TOR1A, DYT-THAP1, DYT-ANO3, DYT-PRKRA, and DYT-HPCA was broader. However, in most DYT-THAP1 and DYT-ANO3 patients, dystonia first manifested in the upper half of the body (upper limb, neck, and craniofacial/laryngeal), whereas onset in DYT-TOR1A, DYT-PRKRA and DYT-HPCA was frequently observed in an extremity, including both upper and lower ones. For ANO3, a segmental/multifocal distribution was typical, whereas TOR1A, PRKRA, KMT2B, and HPCA mutation carriers commonly developed generalized dystonia. THAP1 mutation carriers presented with focal, segmental/multifocal, or generalized dystonia in almost equal proportions. GNAL mutation carriers rarely showed generalization.

Although pathogenic variants to the familial type of dystonia have been extensively reviewed and discussed, relatively little is known about the contribution of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to dystonia. This review focuses on the potential role of SNPs and other variants in dystonia susceptibility.<h4>Methods</h4>We searched the PubMed database for peer-reviewed articles published in English, from its inception through January 2018, that concerned human studies of dystonia and genetic variants. The following search terms were included: \""dystonia\"" in combination with the following terms: 1) \""polymorphisms\"" and 2) \""SNPs\"" as free words.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 43 published studies regarding <i>TOR1A</i>, <i>BDNF</i>, <i>DRD5</i>, <i>APOE</i>, <i>ARSG</i>, <i>NALC</i>, <i>OR4X2</i>, <i>COL4A1</i>, <i>TH</i>, <i>DDC</i>, <i>DBH</i>, <i>MAO</i>, COMT, <i>DAT</i>, <i>GCH1</i>, <i>PRKRA</i>, <i>MR-1</i>, <i>SGCE</i>, <i>ATP1A3</i>, <i>TAF1</i>, <i>THAP1</i>, <i>GNAL</i>, <i>DRD2</i>, <i>HLA-DRB</i>, <i>CBS</i>, <i>MTHFR</i>, and <i>MS</i> genes, were included in the current review.<h4>Discussion</h4>To date, a few variants, which are possibly involved in several molecular pathways, have been related to dystonia. Large cohort studies are needed to determine robust associations between variants and dystonia with adjustment for other potential cofounders, in order to elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms of dystonia and the net effect of the genes.""","""2018""","[""hla-drb"", ""tor1a"", ""arsg"", ""atp1a3"", ""mthfr"", ""gnal"", ""human"", ""patients"", ""patient"", ""infant"", ""mammalian"", ""infants"", ""boy"", ""child"", ""woman"", ""humans"", ""children"", ""girl"", ""mammal"", ""boys"", ""participants"", ""women"", ""man"", ""donor"", ""persons"", ""men"", ""person"", ""people"", ""girls"", ""peoples"", ""participant"", ""outpatient"", ""donor variant"", ""patient variant"", ""mammalians"", ""homo sapiens"", ""pt"", ""homo sapiens linnaeus, 1758"", ""pts"", ""h. sapiens"", ""humans. subsp"", ""human pv"", ""hs"", ""mans"", ""patients. variant"", ""patients. str"", ""pats"", ""patients' variant"", ""mammalia"", ""children. pv"", ""p=ns"", ""human variant"", ""pns"", ""ch"", ""hsa"", ""patients, bv"", ""op"", ""child."", ""patients, pv"", ""patients."", ""patients,"", ""patients. pv"", ""para"", ""patients; str"", ""p = ns"", ""p =ns"", ""pten"", ""human bv"", ""ppl"", ""patients (variant"", ""humans, variant"", ""hu"", ""patients (pv"", ""patients pv"", ""humans, bv"", ""human biovar"", ""ptts"", ""pat"", ""patients (bv"", ""women. bv"", ""women. pv"", ""donor pv"", ""patient, variant"", ""human subspecies"", ""d+/r"", ""patients). pv"", ""patients; variant"", ""patient pv"", ""p"", ""patients), str"", ""pn"", ""dystonia"", ""apoe"", ""movement disorder"", ""cbs"", ""prkra"", ""sgce"", ""or4x2"", ""comt"", ""drd5"", ""gch1"", ""familial type of dystonia"", ""mr-1"", ""taf1"", ""dbh"", ""col4a1"", ""dat"", ""bdnf"", ""drd2"", ""thap1""]"

Autosomal dominant torsion dystonia-1 is a disease with incomplete penetrance most often caused by an in-frame GAG deletion (p.Glu303del) in the endoplasmic reticulum luminal protein torsinA encoded by TOR1A. We report an association of the homozygous dominant disease-causing TOR1A p.Glu303del mutation, and a novel homozygous missense variant (p.Gly318Ser) with a severe arthrogryposis phenotype with developmental delay, strabismus and tremor in three unrelated Iranian families. All parents who were carriers of the TOR1A variant showed no evidence of neurological symptoms or signs, indicating decreased penetrance similar to families with autosomal dominant torsion dystonia-1. The results from cell assays demonstrate that the p.Gly318Ser substitution causes a redistribution of torsinA from the endoplasmic reticulum to the nuclear envelope, similar to the hallmark of the p.Glu303del mutation.

Mutations in the gene encoding epsilon-sarcoglycan (SGCE) have been found in some patients with MDS. SGCE is a maternally imprinted gene with the disease being inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern with reduced penetrance upon maternal transmission. In the central nervous system, epsilon-sarcoglycan is widely expressed in neurons of the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, hippocampus, cerebellum and the olfactory bulb. epsilon-Sarcoglycan is located at the plasma membrane in neurons, muscle and transfected cells. To determine the effect of MDS-associated mutations on the function of epsilon-sarcoglycan we examined the biosynthesis and trafficking of wild-type and mutant proteins in cultured cells. In contrast to the wild-type protein, disease-associated epsilon-sarcoglycan missense mutations (H36P, H36R and L172R) produce proteins that are undetectable at the cell surface and are retained intracellularly. These mutant proteins become polyubiquitinated and are rapidly degraded by the proteasome. Furthermore, torsinA, that is mutated in DYT1 dystonia, a rare type of primary dystonia, binds to and promotes the degradation of epsilon-sarcoglycan mutants when both proteins are co-expressed. These data demonstrate that some MDS-associated mutations in SGCE impair trafficking of the mutant protein to the plasma membrane and suggest a role for torsinA and the ubiquitin proteasome system in the recognition and processing of misfolded epsilon-sarcoglycan.""","""2007""","[""h36p"", ""epsilon-sarcoglycan"", ""human"", ""patients"", ""patient"", ""infant"", ""mammalian"", ""infants"", ""boy"", ""child"", ""woman"", ""humans"", ""children"", ""girl"", ""mammal"", ""boys"", ""participants"", ""women"", ""man"", ""donor"", ""persons"", ""men"", ""person"", ""people"", ""girls"", ""peoples"", ""participant"", ""outpatient"", ""donor variant"", ""patient variant"", ""mammalians"", ""homo sapiens"", ""pt"", ""homo sapiens linnaeus, 1758"", ""pts"", ""h. sapiens"", ""humans. subsp"", ""human pv"", ""hs"", ""mans"", ""patients. variant"", ""patients. str"", ""pats"", ""patients' variant"", ""mammalia"", ""children. pv"", ""p=ns"", ""human variant"", ""pns"", ""ch"", ""hsa"", ""patients, bv"", ""op"", ""child."", ""patients, pv"", ""patients."", ""patients,"", ""patients. pv"", ""para"", ""patients; str"", ""p = ns"", ""p =ns"", ""pten"", ""human bv"", ""ppl"", ""patients (variant"", ""humans, variant"", ""hu"", ""patients (pv"", ""patients pv"", ""humans, bv"", ""human biovar"", ""ptts"", ""pat"", ""patients (bv"", ""women. bv"", ""women. pv"", ""donor pv"", ""patient, variant"", ""human subspecies"", ""d+/r"", ""patients). pv"", ""patients; variant"", ""patient pv"", ""p"", ""patients), str"", ""pn"", ""myoclonus-dystonia syndrome"", ""sgce"", ""psychiatric"", ""l172r"", ""myoclonic jerks"", ""mds"", ""epilepsy"", ""h36r"", ""dyt1 dystonia"", ""torsina"", ""dystonia""]"

"""25461922""","""Identification of a novel human LAP1 isoform that is regulated by protein phosphorylation.""","""Lamina associated polypeptide 1 (LAP1) is an integral protein of the inner nuclear membrane that is ubiquitously expressed. LAP1 binds to lamins and chromatin, probably contributing to the maintenance of the nuclear envelope architecture. Moreover, LAP1 also interacts with torsinA and emerin, proteins involved in DYT1 dystonia and X-linked Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy disorder, respectively. Given its relevance to human pathological conditions, it is important to better understand the functional diversity of LAP1 proteins. In rat, the LAP1 gene (TOR1AIP1) undergoes alternative splicing to originate three LAP1 isoforms (LAP1A, B and C). However, it remains unclear if the same occurs with the human TOR1AIP1 gene, since only the LAP1B isoform had thus far been identified in human cells. In silico analysis suggested that, across different species, potential new LAP1 isoforms could be generated by alternative splicing. Using shRNA to induce LAP1 knockdown and HPLC-mass spectrometry analysis the presence of two isoforms in human cells was described and validated: LAP1B and LAP1C; the latter is putatively N-terminal truncated. LAP1B and LAP1C expression profiles appear to be dependent on the specific tissues analyzed and in cultured cells LAP1C was the major isoform detected. Moreover, LAP1B and LAP1C expression increased during neuronal maturation, suggesting that LAP1 is relevant in this process. Both isoforms were found to be post-translationally modified by phosphorylation and methionine oxidation and two LAP1B/LAP1C residues were shown to be dephosphorylated by PP1. This study permitted the identification of the novel human LAP1C isoform and partially unraveled the molecular basis of LAP1 regulation.""","""2014""","[""dystonia"", ""emerin"", ""rats"", ""rat"", ""sprague-dawley rats"", ""wistar rats"", ""gunn rats"", ""sprague dawley rats"", ""laboratory rats"", ""laboratory rat"", ""brown rat"", ""rattus norvegicus"", ""r. norvegicus"", ""norway rats"", ""brown rats"", ""sprague-dawley rat"", ""sprague dawley rat"", ""sdrs"", ""sdr"", ""norway rat"", ""laboratory"", ""rn"", ""sprague-dawley rat substrain"", ""spd"", ""wistar-rats"", ""sprague - dawley rats"", ""sprague dawley  rat"", ""wistar stra"", ""sprague-dawley stra"", ""wistar) rats"", ""buffalo rat"", ""rat pv"", ""sd rats"", ""sprague"", ""b-/- rats"", ""wr"", ""buffalo rats"", ""buf rats"", ""zitter rats"", ""sprague dawley) rat"", ""sprague dawley stra"", ""sd"", ""sprague-dawley  rats"", ""sprague dawley  rats"", ""sprague -dawley rats"", ""sprague-dawley-rat"", ""sprague- dawley rats"", ""laboratory, rats"", ""r.n"", ""g. rats"", ""rat variant"", ""b - rats"", ""pp1"", ""tor1aip1"", ""x-linked emery-dreifuss muscular dystrophy disorder"", ""methionine"", ""human"", ""patients"", ""patient"", ""infant"", ""mammalian"", ""infants"", ""boy"", ""child"", ""woman"", ""humans"", ""children"", ""girl"", ""mammal"", ""boys"", ""participants"", ""women"", ""man"", ""donor"", ""persons"", ""men"", ""person"", ""people"", ""girls"", ""peoples"", ""participant"", ""outpatient"", ""donor variant"", ""patient variant"", ""mammalians"", ""homo sapiens"", ""pt"", ""homo sapiens linnaeus, 1758"", ""pts"", ""h. sapiens"", ""humans. subsp"", ""human pv"", ""hs"", ""mans"", ""patients. variant"", ""patients. str"", ""pats"", ""patients' variant"", ""mammalia"", ""children. pv"", ""p=ns"", ""human variant"", ""pns"", ""ch"", ""hsa"", ""patients, bv"", ""op"", ""child."", ""patients, pv"", ""patients."", ""patients,"", ""patients. pv"", ""para"", ""patients; str"", ""p = ns"", ""p =ns"", ""pten"", ""human bv"", ""ppl"", ""patients (variant"", ""humans, variant"", ""hu"", ""patients (pv"", ""patients pv"", ""humans, bv"", ""human biovar"", ""ptts"", ""pat"", ""patients (bv"", ""women. bv"", ""women. pv"", ""donor pv"", ""patient, variant"", ""human subspecies"", ""d+/r"", ""patients). pv"", ""patients; variant"", ""patient pv"", ""p"", ""patients), str"", ""pn"", ""lap1b"", ""lap1"", ""torsina"", ""lamina associated polypeptide 1""]"

Given that spinal neural circuits constitute the final pathway for motor control, we sought to determine their contribution to this movement disorder. Focusing on the most common inherited form of dystonia in humans, DYT1-<i>TOR1A</i>, we generated a conditional knockout of the torsin family 1 member A (<i>Tor1a</i>) gene in the mouse spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia (DRG). We found that these mice recapitulated the phenotype of the human condition, developing early-onset generalized torsional dystonia. Motor signs emerged early in the mouse hindlimbs before spreading caudo-rostrally to affect the pelvis, trunk, and forelimbs throughout postnatal maturation. Physiologically, these mice bore the hallmark features of dystonia, including spontaneous contractions at rest and excessive and disorganized contractions, including cocontractions of antagonist muscle groups, during voluntary movements. Spontaneous activity, disorganized motor output, and impaired monosynaptic reflexes, all signs of human dystonia, were recorded from isolated mouse spinal cords from these conditional knockout mice. All components of the monosynaptic reflex arc were affected, including motor neurons. Given that confining the <i>Tor1a</i> conditional knockout to DRG did not lead to early-onset dystonia, we conclude that the pathophysiological substrate of this mouse model of dystonia lies in spinal neural circuits.

Here, we found irregular and decreased spontaneous firing frequency in the acute brain slices from <i>Dyt1</i> KI mice. Quinpirole, a D2R agonist, showed less inhibitory effect on the spontaneous ChI firing in <i>Dyt1</i> KI mice, suggesting decreased D2R function on the striatal ChIs.

Among the few therapeutic options, broad-spectrum antimuscarinic drugs are utilized, aimed at counteracting abnormal striatal acetylcholine-mediated transmission, which plays a crucial role in dystonia pathophysiology. We previously demonstrated a complete loss of long-term synaptic depression (LTD) at corticostriatal synapses in rodent models of two distinct forms of isolated dystonia, resulting from mutations in the TOR1A (DYT1), and GNAL (DYT25) genes. In addition to anticholinergic agents, the aberrant excitability of striatal cholinergic cells can be modulated by group I metabotropic glutamate receptor subtypes (mGlu1 and 5). Here, we tested the efficacy of the negative allosteric modulator (NAM) of metabotropic glutamate 5 (mGlu) receptor, dipraglurant (ADX48621) on striatal LTD. We show that, whereas acute treatment failed to rescue LTD, chronic dipraglurant rescued this form of synaptic plasticity both in DYT1 mice and GNAL rats. Our analysis of the pharmacokinetic profile of dipraglurant revealed a relatively short half-life, which led us to uncover a peculiar time-course of recovery based on the timing from last dipraglurant injection. Indeed, striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs) recorded within 2 h from last administration showed full expression of synaptic plasticity, whilst the extent of recovery progressively diminished when SPNs were recorded 4-6 h after treatment.

Molecularly, it is characterized by hyper-induction of phosphorylation of extracellular signal-related kinase in response to dopamine in medium spiny neurons of the direct pathway.<h4>Objectives</h4>The objective of this study was to determine if mouse models of monogenic dystonia exhibit molecular features of levodopa-induced dyskinesia.<h4>Methods</h4>Western blotting and quantitative immunofluorescence was used to assay baseline and/or dopamine-induced levels of the phosphorylated kinase in the striatum in mouse models of DYT1, DYT6, and DYT25 expressing a reporter in dopamine D1 receptor-expressing projection neurons. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) immunoassay and adenylyl cyclase activity assays were also performed.<h4>Results</h4>In DYT1 and DYT6 models, blocking dopamine reuptake with cocaine leads to enhanced extracellular signal-related kinase phosphorylation in dorsomedial striatal medium spiny neurons in the direct pathway, which is abolished by pretreatment with the N-methyl-d-aspartate antagonist MK-801. Phosphorylation is decreased in a model of DYT25. Levels of basal and stimulated cAMP and adenylyl cyclase activity were normal in the DYT1 and DYT6 mice and decreased in the DYT25 mice. Oxotremorine induced increased abnormal movements in the DYT1 knock-in mice.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The increased dopamine induction of extracellular signal-related kinase phosphorylation in 2 genetic types of dystonia, similar to what occurs in levodopa-induced dyskinesia, and its decrease in a third, suggests that abnormal signal transduction in response to dopamine in the postsynaptic nigrostriatal pathway might be a point of convergence for dystonia and other hyperkinetic movement disorders, potentially offering common therapeutic targets. © 2021 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.""","""2021""","[""dyt1"", ""oxotremorine"", ""cocaine"", ""erk"", ""n-methyl-d-aspartate"", ""camp"", ""mice"", ""mouse"", ""murine"", ""transgenic mice"", ""nude mice"", ""transgenic"", ""mice (pv"", ""mus musculus"", ""house mouse"", ""m. musculus"", ""129/sv"", ""mmu"", ""t/+ mice"", ""mice,"", ""129sv"", ""n/+ mice"", ""mouse variant"", ""mice."", ""mouse:"", ""129 sv"", ""tgm"", ""house mouse subspecies"", ""tg mice"", ""mouse strain"", ""tg"", ""mice. pv"", ""mice. bv"", ""h-/- mouse"", ""mouse substrain"", ""transgenic) mice"", ""t. mice"", ""tr"", ""m:c"", ""mo"", ""h/+ mouse"", ""mice (strain"", ""mu"", ""nude\"" mice"", ""murine str"", ""mouses"", ""nude             mice"", ""tg-mice"", ""transgenic-mice"", ""nm"", ""n (+/+) mice"", ""n(-/-)) mice"", ""n(-/-) mice"", ""mouse biovar"", ""n  mice"", ""mouse subspecies"", ""h mouse"", ""mice. variant"", ""tm"", ""mus musculus,"", ""transgenic, mice"", ""nude-mice"", ""m. m"", ""hyperkinetic movement disorders"", ""dyskinesia"", ""levodopa"", ""adenosine"", ""mk-801"", ""dopamine d1 receptor"", ""dystonia"", ""dopamine"", ""hyperkinetic movement disorder"", ""parkinson and movement disorder""]"

Although the mechanisms underlying the dystonic movements are largely unknown, abnormalities in striatal dopamine and acetylcholine neurotransmission are consistently implicated whereby dopamine release is reduced while cholinergic tone is increased. Because striatal cholinergic neurotransmission mediates dopamine release, it is not known if the dopamine release deficit is mediated indirectly by abnormal acetylcholine neurotransmission or if Tor1a(ΔE) acts directly within dopaminergic neurons to attenuate release. To dissect the microcircuit that governs the deficit in dopamine release, we conditionally expressed Tor1a(ΔE) in either dopamine neurons or cholinergic interneurons in mice and assessed striatal dopamine release using ex vivo fast scan cyclic voltammetry or dopamine efflux using in vivo microdialysis. Conditional expression of Tor1a(ΔE) in cholinergic neurons did not affect striatal dopamine release. In contrast, conditional expression of Tor1a(ΔE) in dopamine neurons reduced dopamine release to 50% of normal, which is comparable to the deficit in Tor1a<sup>+/ΔE</sup> knockin mice that express the mutation ubiquitously. Despite the deficit in dopamine release, we found that the Tor1a(ΔE) mutation does not cause obvious nerve terminal dysfunction as other presynaptic mechanisms, including electrical excitability, vesicle recycling/refilling, Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, D2 dopamine autoreceptor function and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor function, are intact.

However, the nature of such alteration remains unclear.<h4>Objective</h4>The aim of the present work was to characterize the mechanistic basis of cholinergic dysfunction in DYT1 dystonia to identify potential targets for pharmacological intervention.<h4>Methods</h4>We utilized electrophysiology recordings, immunohistochemistry, enzymatic activity assays, and Western blotting techniques to analyze in detail the cholinergic machinery in the dorsal striatum of the Tor1a<sup>+/-</sup> mouse model of DYT1 dystonia.<h4>Results</h4>We found a significant increase in the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) protein level, the protein responsible for loading acetylcholine (ACh) from the cytosol into synaptic vesicles, which indicates an altered cholinergic tone. Accordingly, in Tor1a<sup>+/-</sup> mice we measured a robust elevation in basal ACh content coupled to a compensatory enhancement of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzymatic activity. Moreover, pharmacological activation of dopamine D2 receptors, which is expected to reduce ACh levels, caused an abnormal elevation in its content, as compared to controls. Patch-clamp recordings revealed a reduced effect of AChE inhibitors on cholinergic interneuron excitability, whereas muscarinic autoreceptor function was preserved. Finally, we tested the hypothesis that blockade of VAChT could restore corticostriatal long-term synaptic plasticity deficits. Vesamicol, a selective VAChT inhibitor, rescued a normal expression of synaptic plasticity.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Overall, our findings indicate that VAChT is a key player in the alterations of striatal plasticity and a novel target to normalize cholinergic dysfunction observed in DYT1 dystonia. © 2021 The Authors.

In the current study, we expanded this research field by investigating the critical role of ER stress underlying synaptic plasticity impairment imposed by mutant heterozygous Tor1a<sup>+/-</sup> in a DYT1 dystonia mouse model.<h4>Methods</h4>Heterozygous Tor1a<sup>+/-</sup> mouse model for DYT1 dystonia was established. Wild-type (Tor1a<sup>+/+</sup>, N=10) and mutant (Tor1a<sup>+/-</sup>, N=10) mice from post-natal day P25 to P35 were randomly distributed to experimental and control groups. Patch-clamp and current-clamp recordings of SPNs were conducted with intracellular electrodes for electrophysiological analyses. Striatal changes of the direct and indirect pathways were investigated via immunofluorescence. Golgi-Cox staining was conducted to observe spine morphology of SPNs. To quantify postsynaptic signaling proteins in striatum, RNA-Seq, qRT-PCR and WB were performed in striatal tissues.<h4>Results</h4>Long-term depression (LTD) was failed to be induced, while long-term potentiation (LTP) was further strengthened in striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs) from the Tor1a<sup>+/-</sup> DYT1 dystonia mice. Spine morphology analyses revealed a significant increase of both number of mushroom type spines and spine width in Tor1a<sup>+/-</sup> SPNs. In addition, increased AMPA receptor function and the reduction of NMDA/AMPA ratio in the postsynaptic of Tor1a<sup>+/-</sup> SPNs was observed, along with increased ER stress protein levels in striatum of Tor1a<sup>+/-</sup> DYT1 dystonia mice. Notably, ER stress inhibitors, tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), could rescue LTD as well as AMPA currents.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The current study illustrated the role of ER stress in mediating structural and functional plasticity alterations in Tor1a<sup>+/-</sup> SPNs.

In this review, we highlight current understanding of how this mutation causes disease from research spanning structural biochemistry, cell science, neurobiology, and several model organisms. We now know that homozygosity for ΔGAG has the same effects as Tor1a<sup>KO</sup> , implicating a partial loss of function mechanism in the ΔGAG/+ disease state. In addition, torsinA loss specifically affects neurons in mice, even though the gene is broadly expressed, apparently because of differential expression of homologous torsinB. Furthermore, certain neuronal subtypes are more severely affected by torsinA loss. Interestingly, these include striatal cholinergic interneurons that display abnormal responses to dopamine in several Tor1a animal models. There is also progress on understanding torsinA molecular cell biology. The structural basis of how ΔGAG inhibits torsinA ATPase activity is defined, although mutant torsinA<sup>ΔGAG</sup> protein also displays some characteristics suggesting it contributes to dystonia by a gain-of-function mechanism. Furthermore, a consistent relationship is emerging between torsin dysfunction and membrane biology, including an evolutionarily conserved regulation of lipid metabolism.

We found that cystic-fibrosis-transmembrane-conductance-regulator (CFTR) acts as membrane receptor for gliadin-derived peptide P31-43, as it binds to CFTR and impairs its channel function. P31-43-induced CFTR malfunction generates epithelial stress and intestinal inflammation. Maintaining CFTR in an active open conformation by the CFTR potentiators VX-770 (Ivacaftor) or Vrx-532, prevents P31-43 binding to CFTR and controls gliadin-induced manifestations. Here, we evaluated the possibility that the over-the-counter nutraceutical genistein, known to potentiate CFTR function, would allow to control gliadin-induced alterations. We demonstrated that pre-treatment with genistein prevented P31-43-induced CFTR malfunction and an epithelial stress response in Caco-2 cells. These effects were abrogated when the <i>CFTR</i> gene was knocked out by CRISP/Cas9 technology, indicating that genistein protects intestinal epithelial cells by potentiating CFTR function.

The HLA DR3-DQA1*0501-DQB1*02 (DR3-DQ2) haplotype was primarily associated with a diversified La/Ro RNP response containing precipitating autoantibodies to La (P<0.001); whereas the haplotype HLA DR2-DQA1*0102-DQB1*0602 (DR2-DQ1) was associated with a less diversified La/Ro RNP response containing non-precipitating (restricted epitope) anti-La autoantibodies (P<0.001). Anti-La-positive patients lacking both HLA-DR2 and HLA-DR3 all expressed the HLA-DQA1*0501 allele, which was present at increasing frequency with greater diversification of the anti-La/Ro autoantibody response. The association of distinct HLA haplotypes with different degrees of autoantibody diversification in patients with pSS suggests a model of HLA-restricted presentation of La/Ro peptide determinants to autoreactive helper T cells. We propose that non-precipitating anti-La responses are driven by limited intermolecular help from DR2-DQ1-restricted T helper cells recognizing Ro determinants. On the other hand, we speculate that the more diversified, precipitating anti-La responses obtain more efficient cognate T help from DR3-DQ2-restricted T helper cells recognizing La determinants, where HLA-DQA1*0501 may be a critical determinant for antigen presentation.""","""1998""","[""hla-dqa1"", ""dq1"", ""dq2"", ""dr5"", ""dr3"", ""hla-drb1"", ""patient"", ""dqb1"", ""dqa1"", ""drb1"", ""oligonucleotide"", ""patients"", ""hla"", ""ro (ss-a"", ""ss-b"", ""sjogren's syndrome""]"

Although anti-gliadin antibody (AGA) and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody (ATTGA) were serologically negative, and HLA typing was HLA-DQ6, the patient was ultimately diagnosed as having celiac disease based on the characteristic pathological findings and clinical course. In many cases of celiac disease reported in Japan, serum antibodies such as AGA and ATTGA have not been detected, and HLA testing has been negative for DQ2 or DQ8. Therefore, it is possible that celiac disease in Japan might have different genetic and immunological characteristics than the disease in the US and Europe.

We have performed direct cell cloning of duodenal biopsies from five untreated and one refractory celiac disease patients, and three non-celiac disease control subjects in order to assess, in an unbiased fashion, the frequency of gluten-reactive T cells in the disease-affected tissue as well as the antigen fine specificity of the responding T cells. From the biopsies of active disease lesions of five patients, 19 T-cell clones were found to be gluten-reactive out of total 1,379 clones tested. This gave an average of 1.4% (range 0.7% - 1.9%) of gluten-reactive T cells in lamina propria of active celiac lesions. Interestingly, also the patient with refractory celiac disease had gluten-reactive T cell clones in the lamina propria (5/273; 1.8%). In comparison, we found no gluten-reactive T cells in any of the total 984 T-cell clones screened from biopsies from three disease control donors. Around two thirds of the gluten-reactive clones were reactive to a panel of peptides representing known gluten T-cell epitopes, of which two thirds were reactive to the immunodominant DQ2.5-glia-α1/DQ2.5-glia-α2 and DQ2.5-glia-ω1/DQ2.5-glia-ω2 epitopes. This study shows that gluten-reactive T cells in the inflamed duodenal tissue are prevalent in the active disease lesion, and that many of these T cells are reactive to T-cell epitopes that are not yet characterized.

We aimed to explore this by assessing the genetic risk of type 1 diabetes in autoantibody-negative and -positive children and adults.<h4>Methods</h4>We analysed GAD autoantibodies, insulinoma-2 antigen autoantibodies and zinc transporter-8 autoantibodies (ZnT8A) and measured type 1 diabetes genetic risk by genotyping 30 type 1 diabetes-associated variants at diagnosis in 1814 individuals with clinician-diagnosed type 1 diabetes (1112 adult-onset, 702 childhood-onset). We compared the overall type 1 diabetes genetic risk score (T1DGRS) and non-HLA and HLA (DR3-DQ2, DR4-DQ8 and DR15-DQ6) components with autoantibody status in those with adult-onset and childhood-onset diabetes. We also measured the T1DGRS in 1924 individuals with type 2 diabetes from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium to represent non-autoimmune diabetes control participants.<h4>Results</h4>The T1DGRS was similar in autoantibody-negative and autoantibody-positive clinician-diagnosed childhood-onset type 1 diabetes (mean [SD] 0.274 [0.034] vs 0.277 [0.026], p=0.4). In contrast, the T1DGRS in autoantibody-negative adult-onset type 1 diabetes was lower than that in autoantibody-positive adult-onset type 1 diabetes (mean [SD] 0.243 [0.036] vs 0.271 [0.026], p<0.0001) but higher than that in type 2 diabetes (mean [SD] 0.229 [0.034], p<0.0001). Autoantibody-negative adults were more likely to have the more protective HLA DR15-DQ6 genotype (15% vs 3%, p<0.0001), were less likely to have the high-risk HLA DR3-DQ2/DR4-DQ8 genotype (6% vs 19%, p<0.0001) and had a lower non-HLA T1DGRS (p<0.0001) than autoantibody-positive adults. In contrast to children, autoantibody-negative adults were more likely to be male (75% vs 59%), had a higher BMI (27 vs 24 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and were less likely to have other autoimmune conditions (2% vs 10%) than autoantibody-positive adults (all p<0.0001). In both adults and children, type 1 diabetes genetic risk was unaffected by the number of autoantibodies (p>0.3). These findings, along with the identification of seven misclassified adults with monogenic diabetes among autoantibody-negative adults and the results of a sensitivity analysis with and without measurement of ZnT8A, suggest that the intermediate type 1 diabetes genetic risk in autoantibody-negative adults is more likely to be explained by the inclusion of misclassified non-autoimmune diabetes (estimated to represent 67% of all antibody-negative adults, 95% CI 61%, 73%) than by the presence of unmeasured autoantibodies or by a discrete form of diabetes. When these estimated individuals with non-autoimmune diabetes were adjusted for, the prevalence of autoantibody positivity in adult-onset type 1 diabetes was similar to that in children (93% vs 91%, p=0.4).<h4>Conclusions/interpretation</h4>The inclusion of non-autoimmune diabetes is the most likely explanation for the observed lower rate of autoantibody positivity in clinician-diagnosed adult-onset type 1 diabetes.

This deregulation of the immune system is caused by the action of genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors in varying combinations for each individual. Although the inflammation of the islets with immune cell infiltration, known as insulitis, is an important element in pathogenesis, other factors are necessary for disease initiation. Associations with variants of HLA and other genes related to immune system function, mainly haplotypes HLA-DR3-DQ2 and HLA-DR4-DQ8, are more evident. The influence of polymorphisms and epigenetic modifications, as well as the microbiome, is convincing proof of the existence of a complex interaction between genetic, immune, and environmental factors in the etiology and pathogenesis of this metabolic disorder. Loss of selftolerance to autoimmunity is a critical point in the development of the disease, and regulatory T cells play a key role in this process. Thus, any failure of these cells, either due to an insufficient number or altered expression of cytokines and transcription factors, may be the trigger for the onset of the disease. The protective action of regulatory T cells is controlled by gene expression that is modulated by epigenetic modifications, including the dysregulation of noncoding RNAs.

A statistically significant difference was observed between Turner patients and controls in the frequencies of organ-specific autoantibodies, in particular thyroid microsomal antibodies and thyroglobulin antibodies; however, the presence of autoantibodies was not associated with overt diseases in most cases. No significant difference was found between parents and controls. A study of the inheritance of the autoimmunity showed that transmission was preferentially paternal, since Turner patients had more chance of presenting autoantibodies when their fathers had autoantibodies rather than their mothers. A positive association was found between the presence of auto-antibodies and HLA-DR7;DQ2 and HLA-DR7;DQ9 haplotypes in Turner patients and fathers. No significant association was found between GM and KM allotype frequencies in Turner patients and their parents and the presence of autoantibodies.

The heart thus becomes the target organ for an initial episode of myocardial damage that triggers an autoimmune response.<h4>Hypothesis</h4>The purpose of this study was to analyze the frequency of different human leukocyte antigens in patients with a diagnosis of well-advanced DCM and ischemic heart failure, comparing them with a control group of presumably healthy subjects.<h4>Methods</h4>The group with dilated cardiomyopathy consisted of 50 patients (7 women and 43 men), aged from 14 to 64 years. The group with ischemic heart disease included 76 patients (4 women and 72 men), with ages ranging from 34 to 64.

The disease is rare in the northern hemisphere but is more common in southern and central Africa and the Indian subcontinent. Although rare, its predominance in certain racial groups and their second generation migrants worldwide indicates a genetic as well as a geographic predisposition. The highly polymorphic human leucocyte antigens (HLA) confer genetic susceptibility to several autoimmune disorders. Therefore, a possible link between Mooren's ulcer and HLA type was investigated. METHODS:Patients (n=22) with non-infective destructive peripheral corneal inflammatory disease were recruited worldwide. Differential diagnosis confirmed Mooren's ulceration in 12 cases. HLA typing (HLA-A, B, C, DRB, DQB) was performed by serology and PCR using sequence specific primers. The patients came from varied ethnic backgrounds and their HLA typing results were compared with published data from ethnically matched control populations. RESULTS:Of the 12 patients with Mooren's ulcer, 10 (83%) were HLA-DR17(3) positive (including all nine patients of Asian, Indonesian, and black African origin), and 10 (83%) were HLA-DQ2 positive. The frequency of HLA-DR17(3) and DQ2 was higher in the Mooren's ulcer group compared to published data from ethnically matched control populations, where the expected antigen frequencies range between 5% and 40%.

The aim was also to determine whether the infection with Dobrava virus (DOBV) in Croatia was associated with a more severe illness than the infection with Puumala virus (PUUV).<h4>Patients and methods</h4>To evaluate the scale, case records of 62 HFRS patients hospitalized at the University Hospital for Infectious Diseases in Zagreb from 1995 till 2000 were reviewed. ELISA IgM and IgG tests were used for the detection of specific IgM and IgG antibodies to PUUV or DOBV.<h4>Discussion</h4>HFRS caused by hantaviruses is a zoonotic disease spread worldwide, posing a major public health problem of global dimensions. Recent epidemiologic studies show that almost all parts of Croatia are endemic regions for two hantaviruses, Puumala and Dobrava. The disease severity ranges from subclinical infection to severe illness with fatal outcome. Clinical picture is predominated by fever, myalgia, vomiting, hemorrhagic manifestation, visual impairment and kidney affection. There is still a lack of knowledge concerning all the parameters involved in the disease severity. Besides the type of virus and genetic material, host genes are also associated with the variable clinical course. HLA alleles B8, DR3, and DQ2 are strongly associated with severe outcome of PUUV infection, white HLA B27 allele is associated with a mild course. Whether similar genetic factors also operate in DOBV infection remains to be determined. Recently, a Croatian scale for grading the disease severity was proposed. The disease severity is graded by a scoring system (points attributed to specific clinical symptoms and laboratory findings) as 1--mild, 2--moderate, 3--severe, and 4--very severe. We found 60% of HFRS patients to be infected with PUUV and 40% with DOBV. In our study, 65% of patients infected with PUUV had mild, and 24% moderate disease. Severe and very severe disease was recorded in 11% of PUUV infected patients. In contrast, only 44% of patients infected with DOBV had mild disease, whereas 40% of patients showed a moderate clinical picture. Severe and very severe clinical picture was recorded in 16% of patients with DOBV infection. Statistical analysis showed a significant number of pa (p < 0.01) with PUUV infection to have mild disease, whereas a significant number of HFRS patients infected with DOBV had moderate (p < 0.01) and severe or very severe (p < 0.01) disease.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our results clearly indicate that in Croatia DOBV infection is associated with a more severe disease than PUUV infection. However, we confirmed previous findings that even PUUV infection could lead to a severe disease. Our initial experience in the evaluation of the proposed grading scale for disease severity demonstrated the proposed Croatian scale to be a useful tool in grading disease severity in patients infected with PUUV or DOBV.

We evaluated vaccine response in relation to disease activity and whether previous treatment with a gluten-free diet influences the achievement of protective antibody titers.<h4>Patients and methods</h4>We studied 128 children and adolescents with celiac disease and 113 age-matched control subjects. Twenty-two patients with celiac disease were prospectively immunized after diagnosis during dietary treatment (group 1). A total of 106 (group 2) and the control subjects received vaccination by mass immunization in schools at 14 years of age regardless of diet status and when celiac disease was still undiagnosed in 27 of these children. Diet compliance and celiac disease activity were monitored by measurement of antibodies against transglutaminase and endomysium. Vaccine response was determined by measuring antihepatitis B antibodies from serum.<h4>Results</h4>The seroconversion after hepatitis B vaccination was 95.5% in group 1. All of these patients carried human leukocyte antigen DQ2. The response rate in group 2 was 50.9% and correlated with gluten intake (untreated patients: 25.9%, non-strict diet: 44.4%, strict diet: 61.4%). Treated and compliant patients did not significantly differ from control subjects (75.2%). Thirty-seven antihepatitis B-negative patients with celiac disease received a booster during a controlled gluten-free diet, and 36 (97.3%) seroconverted, irrespective of the presence of human leukocyte antigen DQ2.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Nonresponse to recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen may be a sign of undiagnosed celiac disease. However, there is a good vaccine response in adequately treated patients. Human leukocyte antigen DQ alleles do not seem to have a primary role.

Although prior studies have shown a link between HLA genotypes and ulcerative colitis (UC) susceptibility, none have investigated HLA genotypes and UC-CRC. We therefore investigated HLA-DR/DQ alleles in UC-CRC cases and UC-controls. Furthermore, since methylation of the Class II transactivator (CIITA) gene may silence HLA expression in tumours, we correlated HLA allele frequencies with CIITA gene methylation and HLA-DR expression.<h4>Methods</h4>Cases and controls were matched for duration/extent of ulcerative colitis, age, ethnicity and gender, but not for primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). DNA was extracted from archived tissue blocks from 114 UC-CRC cases and 114 UC-controls. HLA-DR/DQ genotyping was performed using sequence-specific-oligonucleotide polymerase chain reaction (SSO-PCR). CIITA methylation was determined using methylation-specific PCR. HLA-DR immunohistochemistry was done following standard protocols.<h4>Results</h4>UC-CRC cases were more likely than UC-controls to carry the DR17 or DR13 alleles (p<0.0001 or p = 0.02, respectively). Although CIITA methylation did not vary significantly between cases and controls, DR17 and DQ2 were associated with CIITA methylation (p = 0.04 and 0.02, respectively). UC-controls more frequently carried the DR7, DR1 or DQ5 alleles (p = 0.002, 0.05 or 0.01, respectively). After adjusting for PSC, DR17 remained significantly associated with an increased risk for UC-CRC while DR7 and DQ5 remained protective.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We report a significant association between specific HLA alleles and either the risk for (DR17) or protection from (DR7, DQ5) UC-CRC.

While strict adherence to a gluten-free diet induces full recovery in most patients, a small percentage of patients fail to recover. In a subset of these refractory celiac disease patients, an (aberrant) oligoclonal intraepithelial lymphocyte population develops into overt lymphoma. Celiac disease is strongly associated with HLA-DQ2 and/or HLA-DQ8, as both genotypes predispose for disease development. This association can be explained by the fact that gluten peptides can be presented in HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 molecules on antigen presenting cells. Gluten-specific CD4(+) T cells in the lamina propria respond to these peptides, and this likely enhances cytotoxicity of intraepithelial lymphocytes against the intestinal epithelium. We propose a threshold model for the development of celiac disease, in which the efficiency of gluten presentation to CD4(+) T cells determines the likelihood of developing celiac disease and its complications. Key factors that influence the efficiency of gluten presentation include: (1) the level of gluten intake, (2) the enzyme tissue transglutaminase 2 which modifies gluten into high affinity binding peptides for HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8, (3) the HLA-DQ type, as HLA-DQ2 binds a wider range of gluten peptides than HLA-DQ8, (4) the gene dose of HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8, and finally,(5) additional genetic polymorphisms that may influence T cell reactivity.

Of these, 53% expressed HLA-DR15, compared to a 28% HLA-DR15 frequency in col(V) low-responders (p=0.02). After transplantation, patients with HLA-DR1 and -DR17, not -DR15, developed anti-col(V) responses most frequently (p=0.04 and 0.01 vs. controls, respectively). However, recipients of a lung from an HLA-DR15(+)donor were at significantly elevated risk of developing anti-col(V) responses (p=0.02) and BOS (p=0.03). To determine the molecular basis of this unusual pattern of DR allele bias, a peptide library comprising the collagenous region of the α1(V) protein was screened for binding to HLA-DR0101, -DR1501, -DR0301 (DR17) or to HLA-DQ2 (DQA1*0501: DQB1*0201; in linkage disequilibrium with -DR17) and -DQ6 (DQA1*0102: DQB1*0602; linked to -DR15). Eight 15-mer peptides, six DR-binding and two DQ-binding, were identified. HLA-DR15 binding to two peptides yielded the highest binding scores: 650 (where 100 = positive control) for p799 (GIRGLKGTKGEKGED), and 193 for p1439 (LRGIPGPVGEQGLPG). These peptides, which also bound weakly to HLA-DR1, elicited responses in both HLA-DR1(+) and -DR15(+) col(V) reactive hosts, whereas binding and immunoreactivity of p1049 (KDGPPGLRGFPGDRG) was DR15-specific. Remarkably, a col(V)-reactive HLA-DR1(+)DR15(neg) lung transplant patient, whose donor was HLA-DR15(+), responded not only to p799 and p1439, but also to p1049.<h4>Conclusions/significance</h4>HLA-DR15 and IPF disease were independently associated with pre-transplant col(V) autoimmunity.

After approval by the Ethics Committee of our institution, informed consent was acquired from all participants. Forty consecutive patients with nonresponsive CD, aged 17-76 years, underwent MRE using a 1.5T unit. Sequences included T<sub>2</sub> -HASTE, True-FISP, pre- and postcontrast VIBE to assess the quantitative (number of ileal and jejunal folds) and qualitative (fold pattern abnormalities, mural thickening, increased enhancement, bowel dilatation, or intussusception) measures. Endoscopic manifestations were categorized as normal/mild vs. severe. Histopathological results were divided into mild and severe. Genotyping of HLA-DQ2 and DQ8 was performed. Serum levels of tissue-transglutaminase, endomysial, and gliadin antibodies were also determined. Logistic regression analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were used.<h4>Results</h4>Twenty-nine (72.5%) cases showed abnormal MRE. Reversed jejunoileal fold pattern had significant association with severe endoscopic (odds ratio [OR] = 8.38, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.73-40.5) and pathologic features (OR = 7.36, 95% CI 1.33-40.54).

In this paper, a case of Guillain-Barrè syndrome (GBS) as the first manifestation of CD in a 23-month-old child is reported. Case presentation: We describe a case of CD onset with peripheral neuropathy in a 23-month-old Bulgarian boy presenting with a sudden refusal to walk and absence of deep tendon reflexes in both lower limbs. Neurological symptoms were preceded by two months of gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting, abdominal distention, and clear signs of malnutrition and weight loss. When we evaluated the child six months after the onset of the symptoms, clinical and laboratory findings showed clear signs of peripheral neuropathy associated with malnutrition. Serum deamidated gliadin and tissue transglutaminase antibodies were therefore measured. The anti-gliadin levels were more than sixteen times higher than normal and the IgA anti-transglutaminase levels were four times higher than normal. Anti-endomysium antibodies were positive, and human leukocyte antigens (HLA) II typing confirmed a genetic predisposition to CD (DQ2 positive and DQ8 negative). Given the association between the clinical evidence of the disease and the results of the celiac screening tests, a diagnosis of CD was made without biopsy confirmation of the enteropathy. The child began a restricted gluten-free diet that led to complete recovery of the peripheral neuropathy, walking, reflexes, and overall improvement after three months on the diet. Conclusion: Our case underlines the rare but possible associations between CD and peripheral neuropathy in children as an onset symptom, even in the absence of gastrointestinal manifestations, thus suggesting that CD should always be considered in the differential diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy in children. A good knowledge of the extra-intestinal manifestations of CD is essential for the rapid introduction of a gluten-free diet that could be useful for the resolution of the neurological symptoms.""","""2017""","[""enteropathy"", ""dq2"", ""tissue transglutaminase"", ""weight loss"", ""malnutrition"", ""vomiting"", ""gastrointestinal symptoms"", ""boy"", ""peripheral neuropathy"", ""child"", ""children""]"

We analyzed tTGA, high-risk HLA DQ2 and DQ8 (DQX is neither DQ2 nor DQ8) and islet auto-antibodies (GADA, IA-2A, IAA, and three variants of Zinc transporter; ZnT8W, ZnT8R, and ZnT8QA).<h4>Results</h4>Out of 2705 children diagnosed with T1D, 85 (3.1%) had positive tTGA and 63 (2.3%) had borderline values. The prevalence of tTGA was higher in children with the HLA genotypes DQ2/2, DQ2/X or DQ2/8 compared to those with DQ8/8 or DQ8/X (p = .00001) and those with DQX/X (p ≤ .00001). No significant differences were found in relation to islet autoantibodies or age at diagnosis, but the presence of tTGA was more common in girls than in boys (p = .018).<h4>Conclusion</h4>tTGA at T1D diagnosis (both positive and borderline values 5.4%) was higher in girls and in children homozygous for DQ2/2, followed by children heterozygous for DQ2.

We sought to identify historical predictors of FD vs. other primary dystonias (ODs) and develop a practical prediction algorithm to guide neurologists.<h4>Methods</h4>1475 consecutive new patient medical records were reviewed at an adult/pediatric tertiary-referral dystonia clinic from 2005 to 2017. Ninety-nine met criteria for clinically established FD (85 adults and 14 pediatric), paired with 99 age/dystonia distribution-matched OD. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of FD and disability. We formed a prediction algorithm, assessed using the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC).<h4>Results</h4>Multivariate logistic regression analysis investigating independent predictors of FD (P < 0.001) followed by development of a prediction algorithm showed that the most robust predictors included abrupt onset, spontaneous resolution/recurrence, pain, cognitive complaints, being on or pursuing disability, lifetime mood/anxiety disorder, comorbid functional somatic disorders, and having ≥3 medication allergies. The prediction algorithm had utility for both adult and pediatric FD, with excellent sensitivity/specificity (89%/92%) and an area under the curve (AUC) 0.95 (0.92-0.98). Greater disability (modified Rankin Scale) independently correlated with a number of functional examination features, unemployment/not attending school, number of medication allergies, and younger age of presentation. FD patients were high health-care utilizers and were more frequently prescribed opiates/opioids and benzodiazepines (P < 0.003).<h4>Interpretation</h4>This case-control study provides an algorithm to guide clinicians in gauging their index of suspicion for a FD, with diagnostic confirmation subsequently informed by neurological examination.

"""21496605""","""Nonprimary dystonias.""","""Dystonias can be classified as primary or secondary, as dystonia-plus syndromes, and as heredodegenerative dystonias. Their prevalence is difficult to determine. In our experience 80-90% of all dystonias are primary. About 20-30% of those have a genetic background; 10-20% are secondary, with tardive dystonia and dystonia in cerebral palsy being the most common forms. If dystonia in spastic conditions is accepted as secondary dystonia, this is the most common form of all dystonia. In primary dystonias, the dystonic movements are the only symptoms. In secondary dystonias, dystonic movements result from exogenous processes directly or indirectly affecting brain parenchyma. They may be caused by focal and diffuse brain damage, drugs, chemical agents, physical interactions with the central nervous system, and indirect central nervous system effects. Dystonia-plus syndromes describe brain parenchyma processes producing predominantly dystonia together with other movement disorders. They include dopa-responsive dystonia and myoclonus-dystonia. Heredodegenerative dystonias are dystonic movements occurring in the context of other heredodegenerative disorders. They may be caused by impaired energy metabolism, impaired systemic metabolism, storage of noxious substances, oligonucleotid repeats and other processes. Pseudodystonias mimic dystonia and include psychogenic dystonia and various orthopedic, ophthalmologic, vestibular, and traumatic conditions. Unusual manifestations, unusual age of onset, suspect family history, suspect medical history, and additional signs may indicate nonprimary dystonia. If they are suspected, etiological clarification becomes necessary. Unfortunately, potential etiologies are legion. Diagnostic algorithms can be helpful. Treatment of nonprimary dystonias, with few exceptions, does not differ from treatment of primary dystonias. The most effective treatment for focal and segmental dystonias is local botulinum toxin injections. Deep brain stimulation of the globus pallidus internus is effective for generalized dystonia. Antidystonic drugs, including anticholinergics, tetrabenazine, clozapine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor agonists, are less effective and often produce adverse effects. Dopamine is extremely effective in dopa-responsive dystonia. The Bertrand procedure can be effective in cervical dystonia. Other peripheral surgery, including myotomy, myectomy, neurotomy, rhizotomy, ramizectomy, and accessory nerve neurolysis, has largely been abandoned. Central surgery other than deep brain stimulation is obsolete. Adjuvant therapies, including orthoses, physiotherapy, ergotherapy, behavioral therapy, social support, and support groups, may be helpful.

In contrast, adult-onset dystonia is relatively common, typically sporadic and usually remains focal. To date, 19 different forms of monogenic dystonia (primary dystonias and dystonia-plus syndromes) have been identified and classified as DYT loci. Likewise, secondary dystonia is a feature of a large number of hereditary conditions, such as Wilson disease or neuroacanthocytosis. This review focuses on the eight monogenic primary dystonias, six of which are associated with an early-onset generalized phenotype (DYT1, 2, 4, 6, 16 and 17), while the remaining two are characterized by an adolescent- or adult-onset focal or segmental form of dystonia (DYT7 and 13).<h4>Discussion</h4>Primary dystonias have a strong genetic component that is most obvious in the rare monogenic early-onset generalized forms. However, genetic risk factors also are likely to play an important role in the pathophysiology of the much more common late-onset focal and segmental primary dystonias.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The identification of these genetic factors is a critical future aim in dystonia research.""","""2010""","[""neuroacanthocytosis"", ""dystonias"", ""wilson disease"", ""dyt1, 2, 4, 6, 16 and 17"", ""dystonia-plus syndromes"", ""dyt7"", ""dystonia"", ""primary dystonias""]"

While gross brain lesions can produce secondary dystonias, advanced neuroimaging techniques have been required to identify network abnormalities in primary dystonias. Prior neuroimaging studies have provided valuable insights into the pathophysiology of dystonia, but few directly assessed the gross volume of motor control regions, and to our knowledge, none identified abnormalities common to multiple types of idiopathic focal dystonia.<h4>Methods</h4>We used two gross volumetric segmentation techniques and one voxelwise volumetric technique (voxel based morphometry, VBM) to compare regional volume between matched healthy controls and patients with idiopathic primary focal dystonia (cervical, n = 17, laryngeal, n = 7). We used (1) automated gross volume measures of eight motor control regions using the FreeSurfer analysis package; (2) blinded, anatomist-supervised manual segmentation of the whole thalamus (also gross volume); and (3) voxel based morphometry, which measures local T1-weighted signal intensity and estimates gray matter density or volume at the level of single voxels, for both whole-brain and thalamus.<h4>Results</h4>Using both automated and manual gross volumetry, we found a significant volume decrease only in the thalamus in two focal dystonias. Decreases in whole-thalamic volume were independent of head and brain size, laterality of symptoms, and duration. VBM measures did not differ between dystonia and control groups in any motor control region.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Reduced thalamic gross volume, detected in two independent analyses, suggests a common anatomical abnormality in cervical dystonia and spasmodic dysphonia.

It is characterized by involuntary convulsive muscle contractions of the M. orbicularis occuli, accompanied by unbearable pain of the cornea, eye bulb and the muscle itself. It has been suggested that blepharospasm is neurobiologically based on a dysfunction of the basal ganglia and an impairment of the dopamine neurotransmitter system. Therefore, therapy of blepharospasm contains administration of anticholinergic- and tranquillizing drugs as well as botulinum toxin as neuromuscular blocking agent. However serious side effects can be observed as well as failure of therapy. In the brain a dense co-localisation of cannabinoid (CB1) and dopamine (D2)-receptor was identified which had been associated with the influence of cannabinoids on the dopaminergic reward system. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that cannabinoids may have an impact on the central GABAergic and glutaminergic transmitter system and thus might be involved in the influence of movement control. In the present case we administered the cannabinoid receptor agonist Dronabinol (Delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol) to a woman suffering from severe blepharospasm. Multiple treatments with botulinum toxin did not reveal a long-lasting beneficial effect. By contrast, treatment with 25 mg Dronabinol for several weeks improved the patients' social life and attenuated pain perception remarkably.

The temporal discrimination threshold (TDT) is the shortest time interval at which two stimuli are detected to be asynchronous. We aimed to compare the sensitivity and specificity of three different TDT tasks (visual, tactile and mixed/visual-tactile). We also aimed to examine the sensitivity of TDTs in different AOPTD phenotypes. To examine tasks, we tested TDT in 41 patients and 51 controls using visual (2 lights), tactile (non-painful electrical stimulation) and mixed (1 light, 1 electrical) stimuli. To investigate phenotypes, we examined 71 AOPTD patients (37 cervical dystonia, 14 writer's cramp, 9 blepharospasm, 11 spasmodic dysphonia) and 8 musician's dystonia patients.

We systematically examined familial Amish-Mennonite dystonia cases, identifying five additional members from the original families, as well as three other multiplex Amish-Mennonite families, and evaluated the known DYT6 haplotype and recombination events. One of the three new families carried the shared haplotype, whereas the region was excluded in the two other families, suggesting genetic heterogeneity for PTD in the Amish-Mennonites. Clinical features in the five newly identified DYT6 carriers were similar to those initially described. In contrast, affected individuals from the excluded families had a later age of onset (46.9 years vs. 16.1 years in the DYT6), and the dystonia was both more likely to be of focal distribution and begin in the cervical muscles. Typing of additional markers in the DYT6-linked families revealed recombinations that now place the gene in a 23 cM region surrounding the centromere.

"""21907099""","""Genetics and pharmacological treatment of dystonia.""","""Dystonia consists of involuntary repetitive twisting (torsion) or directional movements, sometimes leading to sustained postures. The movements are stereotyped and characterized by co-contraction of agonist and antagonist muscles. There is a broad clinical spectrum of dystonia which derives in part from the differential distribution of involvement. Dystonia may be localized, affecting a single body region, or generalized, affecting multiple extremities along with the trunk. Intermediate dystonic involvement can be described as segmental, designating two affected contiguous body regions, or multifocal, designating two or more noncontiguous affected body regions. Hemidystonia refers to dystonia affecting only one side of the body. Dystonia can also be categorized by age of onset and etiology. Early onset dystonia, occurring in childhood or adolescence (in some studies younger than 26 years old), is associated with more progressive disease [Greene et al. (1995). Mov. Disord. 10, 143]. In this age group, dystonia usually first appears in a limb and then spreads to involve other limbs and axial muscles; some early-onset patients may have involvement of laryngeal and other cranial muscles. Adult or late-onset dystonia typically begins in the neck, arm, or cranial muscles. Compared to early-onset dystonia, the area of involvement is more likely to remain focal or segmental. Dystonia can be considered either primary or nonprimary. Primary torsion dystonia (PTD), historically called dystonia musculorum deformans and Oppenheim's dystonia, describes dystonia in isolation, excepting tremor, without brain degeneration and without an identified acquired cause. Nonprimary or secondary dystonia encompasses a heterogeneous group of syndromes and etiologies including inherited (with or without brain degeneration), acquired, and complex neurological disorders. Monogenic forms of dystonia are labeled DYT and enumerated in the order in which they were discovered. The current 20 DYT loci comprise a heterogeneous group of disorders. (Table I) They can be divided into PTDs, dystonia-plus syndromes without brain degeneration, dystonia-parkinsonism with brain degeneration (i.e. DYT3), and paroxysmal dyskinesias. There are many neurodegenerative genetic disorders that share dystonia as a common feature of disease (Table II).

In 1971 we reported the first two cases of recessive dopa-responsive dystonia, simulating a severe form of idiopathic DMD, however remarkably well reacting to levodopa treatment. We found that the first above mentioned two cases are related to mutations in the tyrosine hydroxylase gene itself in the chromosome 11p. An other variety which is dominant, with marked diurnal fluctuation, is due to mutations of a cofactor of the tyrosine hydroxylase, located in chromosome 14q. Consequently a trial of dopa treatment should be given in all diseases evoking a DMD diagnosis.

The mutation follows an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance and has been named dystonic (dt). The rat mutants are indistinguishable from normal littermates in open field behavior and climbing activity prior to postnatal days 9 to 10. Clinical signs begin to appear on day 10 and include twisting of the axial musculature, hyperflexion of the trunk, self-clasping of forelimbs and hindlimbs, and poor placement of the limbs during locomotion. No morphological lesions of neural or non-neural tissues have been observed with routine light microscopy. Dystonic rats demonstrate significantly elevated cerebellar norepinephrine levels, although levels in other terminal fields of the locus ceruleus are similar to those of normal littermates. No differences in the pattern or density of noradrenergic innervation were apparent in cerebellar tissue from dt rats examined with histochemical fluorescence techniques. These mutants were less sensitive than unaffected littermates to the akinesic effects of the dopamine blocker haloperidol. However, striatal dopamine levels were not reliably different from normal in dt rats, and their response to the movement-stimulating effects of apomorphine appeared normal. These findings suggest the presence of biochemical disturbances in the extrapyramidal system of dt rats.

"""26417535""","""Early Illustrations of Geste Antagoniste in Cervical and Generalized Dystonia.""","""<h4>Background</h4>Geste antagoniste, or sensory trick, is a voluntary maneuver that temporarily reduces the severity of dystonic postures or movements. We present a historical review of early reports and illustrations of geste antagoniste.<h4>Results</h4>In 1894, Brissaud described this phenomenon in Paris in patients with torticollis. He noted that a violent muscular contraction could be reversed by a minor voluntary action. He considered the improvement obtained by what he called \""simple mannerisms, childish behaviour or fake pathological movements\"" was proof of the psychogenic origin of what he named mental torticollis. This concept was supported by photographical illustrations of the patients. The term geste antagoniste was used by Brissaud's pupils, Meige and Feindel, in their 1902 monograph on movement disorders. Other reports and illustrations of this sign were published in Europe between 1894 and 1906. Although not mentioned explicitly, geste antagoniste was also illustrated in a case report of generalized dystonia in Oppenheim's 1911 seminal description of dystonia musculorum deformans in Berlin.<h4>Discussion</h4>Brissaud-Meige's misinterpretation of the geste antagoniste unfortunately anchored the psychogenic origin of dystonia for decades. In New York, Herz brought dystonia back into the realm of organic neurology in 1944. Thereafter, it was given prominence by other authors, notably Fahn and Marsden in the 1970-1980s. Nowadays, neurologists routinely investigate for geste antagoniste when a dystonic syndrome is suspected, because it provides a further argument in favor of dystonia. The term alleviating maneuver was proposed in 2014 to replace sensory trick or geste antagoniste. This major sign is now part of the motor phenomenology of the 2013 Movement Disorder Society's classification of dystonia.""","""2015""","[""movement disorders"", ""human"", ""patients"", ""patient"", ""infant"", ""mammalian"", ""infants"", ""boy"", ""child"", ""woman"", ""humans"", ""children"", ""girl"", ""mammal"", ""boys"", ""participants"", ""women"", ""man"", ""donor"", ""persons"", ""men"", ""person"", ""people"", ""girls"", ""peoples"", ""participant"", ""outpatient"", ""donor variant"", ""patient variant"", ""mammalians"", ""homo sapiens"", ""pt"", ""homo sapiens linnaeus, 1758"", ""pts"", ""h. sapiens"", ""humans. subsp"", ""human pv"", ""hs"", ""mans"", ""patients. variant"", ""patients. str"", ""pats"", ""patients' variant"", ""mammalia"", ""children. pv"", ""p=ns"", ""human variant"", ""pns"", ""ch"", ""hsa"", ""patients, bv"", ""op"", ""child."", ""patients, pv"", ""patients."", ""patients,"", ""patients. pv"", ""para"", ""patients; str"", ""p = ns"", ""p =ns"", ""pten"", ""human bv"", ""ppl"", ""patients (variant"", ""humans, variant"", ""hu"", ""patients (pv"", ""patients pv"", ""humans, bv"", ""human biovar"", ""ptts"", ""pat"", ""patients (bv"", ""women. bv"", ""women. pv"", ""donor pv"", ""patient, variant"", ""human subspecies"", ""d+/r"", ""patients). pv"", ""patients; variant"", ""patient pv"", ""p"", ""patients), str"", ""pn"", ""dystonic syndrome"", ""voluntary maneuver"", ""dystonia musculorum deformans"", ""dystonic postures"", ""dystonia back"", ""dystonia""]"

"""12518301""","""Secondary cervical dystonia associated with structural lesions of the central nervous system.""","""We tested the hypothesis that structural lesions of the central nervous system (CNS) associated with cervical dystonia more commonly involve the cerebellum and its primary afferent pathways than basal ganglia structures. Cervical dystonia is the most common focal dystonia, the majority of cases are idiopathic, and only a small percentage of patients have a family history of dystonia or other movement disorders. Pathophysiological mechanisms operative in solely or predominantly appendicular dystonias such as writer's cramp and Oppenheim's dystonia, respectively, may not be directly applicable to axial dystonias. The localization of structural lesions of the CNS associated with secondary cervical dystonia may provide some insight into the neural structures potentially involved in primary cervical dystonia. The National Library of Medicine Gateway (from 1960) and a clinical database maintained by the senior author (from 1999) were searched for cases of secondary cervical dystonia associated with structural lesions of the CNS. Search terms included one or more of the following: dystonia, torticollis, cervical, secondary, and symptomatic. Lesion localization and type, patient age, patient gender, head position, occurrence of sensory tricks, and associated neurological findings were tabulated for each case. Structural lesions associated with cervical dystonia were most commonly localized to the brainstem and cerebellum. The remaining cases were equally divided between the cervical spinal cord and basal ganglia. Although inconsistent, head rotation tended to be contralateral to lesion localization.

"""36757831""","""The clinical and genetic spectrum of autosomal-recessive TOR1A-related disorders.""","""In the field of rare diseases, progress in molecular diagnostics led to the recognition that variants linked to autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative diseases of later onset can, in the context of biallelic inheritance, cause devastating neurodevelopmental disorders and infantile or childhood-onset neurodegeneration. TOR1A-associated arthrogryposis multiplex congenita 5 (AMC5) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder arising from biallelic variants in TOR1A, a gene that in the heterozygous state is associated with torsion dystonia-1 (DYT1 or DYT-TOR1A), an early-onset dystonia with reduced penetrance. While 15 individuals with AMC5-TOR1A have been reported (less than 10 in detail), a systematic investigation of the full disease-associated spectrum has not been conducted. Here, we assess the clinical, radiological and molecular characteristics of 57 individuals from 40 families with biallelic variants in TOR1A. Median age at last follow-up was 3 years (0-24 years). Most individuals presented with severe congenital flexion contractures (95%) and variable developmental delay (79%). Motor symptoms were reported in 79% and included lower limb spasticity and pyramidal signs, as well as gait disturbances. Facial dysmorphism was an integral part of the phenotype, with key features being a broad/full nasal tip, narrowing of the forehead and full cheeks. Analysis of disease-associated manifestations delineated a phenotypic spectrum ranging from normal cognition and mild gait disturbance to congenital arthrogryposis, global developmental delay, intellectual disability, absent speech and inability to walk. In a subset, the presentation was consistent with foetal akinesia deformation sequence with severe intrauterine abnormalities. Survival was 71%, with higher mortality in males. Death occurred at a median age of 1.2 months (1 week-9 years), due to respiratory failure, cardiac arrest or sepsis. Analysis of brain MRI studies identified non-specific neuroimaging features, including a hypoplastic corpus callosum (72%), foci of signal abnormality in the subcortical and periventricular white matter (55%), diffuse white matter volume loss (45%), mega cisterna magna (36%) and arachnoid cysts (27%). The molecular spectrum included 22 distinct variants, defining a mutational hotspot in the C-terminal domain of the Torsin-1A protein. Genotype-phenotype analysis revealed an association of missense variants in the 3-helix bundle domain to an attenuated phenotype, while missense variants near the Walker A/B motif as well as biallelic truncating variants were linked to early death. In summary, this systematic cross-sectional analysis of a large cohort of individuals with biallelic TOR1A variants across a wide age-range delineates the clinical and genetic spectrum of TOR1A-related autosomal-recessive disease and highlights potential predictors for disease severity and survival.""","""2023""","[""tor1a"", ""autosomal-recessive disease"", ""death"", ""torsin-1a"", ""c"", ""arachnoid cysts"", ""white matter volume loss"", ""hypoplastic corpus callosum"", ""sepsis"", ""cardiac arrest"", ""respiratory failure"", ""mortality"", ""akinesia deformation"", ""inability"", ""congenital arthrogryposis"", ""facial dysmorphism"", ""lower limb spasticity"", ""congenital flexion contractures"", ""dystonia"", ""dyt1"", ""torsion dystonia-1"", ""neurodevelopmental disorder"", ""arthrogryposis multiplex congenita"", ""neurodegeneration"", ""neurodevelopmental disorders"", ""autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative diseases""]"

PET scans from 267 children with dystonia being evaluated for possible Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) surgery between September 2007 and February 2018 at Evelina London Children's Hospital (ELCH) United Kingdom were examined.

Twelve forms are inherited as autosomal dominant, four as autosomal recessive and one as an X-linked recessive trait. Three additional autosomal dominant forms (DYT9, DYT19 and DYT20) might exist based on linkage mapping to regions apparently different from, yet in close proximity to or overlapping with the known loci DYT18, DYT10 and DYT8. Clinically, this group of movement disorders includes pure dystonias and dystonia plus syndromes. In addition, dyskinesias (paroxysmal dystonias), although phenotypically distinct from classical dystonias, are discussed within this group. In pure dystonias, dystonia is occasionally accompanied by tremor. In dystonia plus syndromes, dystonia as the prominent sign concurs with other movement abnormalities such as myoclonus and parkinsonism. In the dyskinesias, dystonia occurs as a paroxysmal sign in association with other movement anomalies and sometimes seizures. While gross neuropathological changes are absent in most primary dystonias, including the paroxysmal forms, striking morphological alterations are found in some, such as in the X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism syndrome (DYT3). Neuropathological findings at the microscopic level have also been reported in several cases of dystonia 1 and 5, both of which were previously thought to be morphologically normal. One locus, DYT14 had been erroneously assigned, by linkage mapping, in a family with dystonia 5. There are two forms of dystonia 5, one autosomal dominant and one autosomal recessive. These forms are designated here as dystonia 5a and dystonia 5b (DYT5a, DYT5b), respectively.

"""20301665""","""DYT1 Early-Onset Isolated Dystonia""","""<h4>Clinical characteristics</h4>DYT1 early-onset isolated dystonia typically presents in childhood or adolescence and only on occasion in adulthood. Dystonic muscle contractions causing posturing or irregular tremor of a leg or arm are the most common presenting findings. Dystonia is usually first apparent with specific actions such as writing or walking. Over time, the contractions frequently (but not invariably) become evident with less specific actions and spread to other body regions. No other neurologic abnormalities are present. Disease severity varies considerably even within the same family. Isolated writer's cramp may be the only sign.<h4>Diagnosis/testing</h4>The diagnosis of DYT1 dystonia is established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous TOR1A pathogenic variant on molecular genetic testing. A TOR1A three base-pair deletion, c.907_909delGAG, is identified in most affected individuals.<h4>Management</h4>Treatment of manifestations: Oral medications, either alone or in combination, are usually tried first, including anticholinergics, baclofen, benzodiazepines, and others. Botulinum toxin injections for treatment of focal symptoms can be used in conjunction with oral medications. If oral medications and botulinum toxin injections do not provide sufficient control of symptoms, surgery enabling deep-brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus interna (GPi) should be considered. Prevention of secondary complications: Aggressive medical and surgical intervention to prevent contractures of the joints and deformities of the spine. Surveillance: Follow up with a neurologist specializing in movement disorders several times a year. Agents/circumstances to avoid: The extremities affected by dystonia should not be placed in a brace or cast, unless medically necessary, as this can worsen the dystonia.<h4>Genetic counseling</h4>DYT1 dystonia is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner with reduced penetrance. Offspring of an affected individual or of an asymptomatic individual known to have a TOR1A pathogenic variant have a 50% chance of inheriting the variant and if inherited a 30% chance of developing clinical findings.

Classification is based on two main axes: clinical features and etiology. Currently, genes have been reported for 14 types of monogenic isolated and combined dystonia. Isolated dystonia (with dystonic tremor) can be caused by mutations in TOR1A (DYT1), TUBB4 (DYT4), THAP1 (DYT6), PRKRA (DYT16), CIZ1 (DYT23), ANO3 (DYT24), and GNAL (DYT25).

Recent insights from neurophysiologic studies identified functional abnormalities in two networks in dystonia: the basal ganglia-sensorimotor network and, more recently, the cerebellothalamocortical pathway. Besides the well-known lack of inhibition at different CNS levels, dystonia is specifically characterized by maladaptive plasticity in the sensorimotor cortex and loss of cortical surround inhibition. The exact role (modulatory or compensatory) of the cerebellar-cortical pathways still has to be further elucidated. In addition to botulinum toxin for focal forms, deep brain stimulation of the globus pallidus internus is increasingly recognized as an effective treatment for generalized and segmental dystonia.<h4>Summary</h4>The revised classification and identification of new genes for different forms of dystonia, including adult-onset segmental dystonia, enable an improved diagnostic approach. Recent pathophysiologic insights have fundamentally contributed to a better understanding of the disease mechanisms and impact on treatment, such as functional neurosurgery and nonpharmacologic treatment options.""","""2013""","[""pnkd"", ""segmental dystonia"", ""ganglia-sensorimotor"", ""functional abnormalities"", ""dyt18"", ""slc2a1"", ""dyt10"", ""prrt2"", ""dyt8"", ""dystonia"", ""dystonic tremor"", ""tor1a"", ""dyt1"", ""tubb4"", ""dyt4"", ""thap1"", ""dyt6"", ""prkra"", ""dyt16"", ""ciz1"", ""dyt23"", ""ano3"", ""dyt24"", ""gnal"", ""dyt25"", ""combined dystonias"", ""parkinsonism"", ""myoclonus"", ""dyt5"", ""sgce"", ""dyt11"", ""atp1a3"", ""dyt12"", ""taf1"", ""dyt3""]"

A revised definition and a new classification of dystonia have now been proposed by a group of leading dystonia experts and will be referred here. The discovery of the first two gene mutations causing primary generalized dystonia (DYT1-TOR1A and DYT6-THAP1) has facilitated studies on pathogenesis and pathophysiology of primary dystonias, by comparing neurophysiology between manifesting and non-manifesting carriers, and by studying the molecular biology of the mutant gene products. During recent years, several other gene mutations causing primary dystonia, dystonia-plus, and paroxysmal dystonia disorders have been discovered. Only during the last year, by the use of whole-exome sequencing techniques, mutations in three different genes in families with predominantly cervical dystonia were found, which may lead to improved insight into the pathogenesis also of the more frequent focal dystonias. Botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) and deep brain stimulation (DBS) have revolutionized the symptomatic treatment for dystonia during the last two decades and continue to be refined to improve efficacy and expand their indications.

In addition, although emphasis has been placed on dominant isolated dystonia, the disorder is also transmitted as a recessive trait, for which no mutations have been defined. Using whole-exome sequencing in a recessive isolated dystonia-affected kindred, we identified disease-segregating compound heterozygous mutations in COL6A3, a collagen VI gene associated previously with muscular dystrophy. Genetic screening of a further 367 isolated dystonia subjects revealed two additional recessive pedigrees harboring compound heterozygous mutations in COL6A3. Strikingly, all affected individuals had at least one pathogenic allele in exon 41, including an exon-skipping mutation that induced an in-frame deletion. We tested the hypothesis that disruption of this exon is pathognomonic for isolated dystonia by inducing a series of in-frame deletions in zebrafish embryos. Consistent with our human genetics data, suppression of the exon 41 ortholog caused deficits in axonal outgrowth, whereas suppression of other exons phenocopied collagen deposition mutants. All recessive mutation carriers demonstrated early-onset segmental isolated dystonia without muscular disease. Finally, we show that Col6a3 is expressed in neurons, with relevant mRNA levels detectable throughout the adult mouse brain.

In this study, we used an engineered Cas9 variant from Streptococcus pyogenes (SpCas9-VRQR) to target the mutation in the TOR1A gene in order to disrupt mutant torsinA in DYT1 patient fibroblasts. Selective targeting of the DYT1 allele was highly efficient with most common non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) edits, leading to a predicted premature stop codon with loss of the torsinA C terminus (delta 302-332 aa). Structural analysis predicted a functionally inactive status of this truncated torsinA due to the loss of residues associated with ATPase activity and binding to LULL1. Immunoblotting showed a reduction of the torsinA protein level in Cas9-edited DYT1 fibroblasts, and a functional assay using HSV infection indicated a phenotypic recovery toward that observed in control fibroblasts.

However, the effect of DBS appears to be less predictable in patients with DYT6, suggesting that pre-DBS genetic testing and counseling for known dystonia gene mutations may be indicated.

DYT1 early-onset primary dystonia is the most common form of hereditary dystonia and is caused by deletion of a glutamic acid residue (302/303) near the carboxyl-terminus of encoded torsinA. TorsinA is localized primarily within the contiguous lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and nuclear envelope (NE), and is hypothesized to function as a molecular chaperone and an important regulator of the ER stress-signaling pathway, but how the mutation in torsinA causes disease remains unclear. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the clinical symptoms of dystonia result from abnormalities in dopamine (DA) signaling, and possibly involving its down-stream effector adenylate cyclase that produces the second messenger cyclic adenosine-3', 5'-monophosphate (cAMP). Here we find that mutation in torsinA induces ER stress, and inhibits the cyclic adenosine-3', 5'-monophosphate (cAMP) response to the adenylate cyclase agonist forskolin. Both defective mechanins are corrected by the small molecule 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA) that alleviates ER stress. Our results link torsinA, the ER-stress-response, and cAMP-dependent signaling, and suggest 4-PBA could also be used in dystonia treatment. Other pharmacological agents known to modulate the cAMP cascade, and ER stress may also be therapeutic in dystonia patients and can be tested in the models described here, thus supplementing current efforts centered on the dopamine pathway.""","""2014""","[""dopamine"", ""patients"", ""camp"", ""4-pba"", ""4-phenylbutyrate"", ""adenosine"", ""dystonia"", ""torsina"", ""glutamic acid"", ""hereditary dystonia"", ""primary dystonia"", ""dyt1"", ""neurological disorder"", ""cyclic amp""]"

While LAP1 lacks canonical nucleotide binding motifs, its strictly conserved arginine 563 is positioned exactly where the arginine finger of canonical AAA+ ATPases is found. Based on modeling and electron microscopic analysis, we propose that LAP1 targets Torsin to the nuclear envelope by forming an alternating, heterohexameric (LAP1-Torsin)3 ring, in which LAP1 acts as the Torsin activator. The experimental data show that mutation of arginine 563 in LAP1 reduces its ability to stimulate TorsinA ATPase hydrolysis.

To understand the pathophysiology of these disorders better, we compared the similarities and differences in functional neuroimaging of patients with psychogenic dystonia and genetically determined dystonia, and tested hypotheses on the role of the prefrontal cortex in functional neurological disorders. Patients with psychogenic (n = 6) or organic (n = 5, DYT1 gene mutation positive) dystonia of the right leg, and matched healthy control subjects (n = 6) underwent positron emission tomography of regional cerebral blood flow. Participants were studied during rest, during fixed posturing of the right leg and during paced ankle movements.

Averaging regional cerebral blood flow across all tasks, the organic dystonia group showed abnormal increases in the primary motor cortex and thalamus compared with controls, with decreases in the cerebellum. In contrast, the psychogenic dystonia group showed the opposite pattern, with abnormally increased blood flow in the cerebellum and basal ganglia, with decreases in the primary motor cortex. Comparing organic dystonia with psychogenic dystonia revealed significantly greater regional blood flow in the primary motor cortex, whereas psychogenic dystonia was associated with significantly greater blood flow in the cerebellum and basal ganglia (all P < 0.05, family-wise whole-brain corrected).

Assessment should be performed using a validated rating scale for dystonia. Genetic testing may be performed after establishing the clinical diagnosis. DYT1 testing is recommended for patients with primary dystonia with limb onset before age 30, and in those with an affected relative with early-onset dystonia. DYT6 testing is recommended in early-onset or familial cases with cranio-cervical dystonia or after exclusion of DYT1. Individuals with early-onset myoclonus should be tested for mutations in the DYT11 gene. If direct sequencing of the DYT11 gene is negative, additional gene dosage is required to improve the proportion of mutations detected.

We have focussed on (i) primary generalized dystonia, (ii) cervical dystonia, (iii) writer's cramp and (iv) fixed dystonia related to complex regional pain syndrome. We have studied medical texts published since the 19th century and their references. Jean-Martin Charcot advocated the concept of hysteria, disorders in which, besides predisposition, environmental factors were involved in their pathogenesis. Sigmund Freud introduced psychoanalysis as an explanatory therapy for psychic disorders. Previous theories, together with the lack of an organic substrate for dystonia, made a strong case for psychogenic explanations. Consequently, many dystonia patients were told that they suffered from psychological conflicts and were treated for them. However, after the description of new hereditary cases in the 1950s, the limited efficacy of psychotherapy in torsion dystonia, the effects of surgical treatments and the lesion studies in the 1960s, more physicians became convinced of the organic nature. The culminating point was the discovery of the DYT1 gene in 1997. In the meantime, experts had already convinced the neurological community that cervical dystonia and writer's cramp were focal dystonias, i.e. minor forms of generalized dystonia, and therefore organic disorders. In contrast, the pathophysiology of fixed dystonia related to complex regional pain syndrome remained controversial. Knowledge of this history, which played on the border between neurology and psychiatry, is instructive and reflects the difficulty in discriminating between them. Today, new insights from functional imaging and neurophysiological studies again challenge the interpretation of these disorders, while the border between psychogenic and organic has become more blurred.

Using immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, we first established that the related transmembrane proteins LULL1 and LAP1 are prominent binding partners for torsinA in U2OS cells. Comparative analysis demonstrates that these two proteins are targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum or nuclear envelope by their divergent N-terminal domains. Binding of torsinA to their C-terminal lumenal domains is stabilized when residues in any one of three motifs implicated in ATP hydrolysis (Walker B, sensor 1, and sensor 2) are mutated. Importantly, the DeltaGAG deletion does not stabilize this binding. Indeed, deleting the DeltaGAG encoded glutamic acid residue from any of the three ATP hydrolysis mutants destabilizes their association with LULL1 and LAP1C, suggesting a possible basis for loss of torsinA function.

Biochemical, structural and cell biological studies have been performed in order to characterise torsinA. These studies, together with the generation of several animal models, have contributed to identify cellular compartments and pathways, including the cytoskeleton and the nuclear envelope, the secretory pathway and the synaptic vesicle machinery where torsinA function may be crucial. However, the role of torsinA and the correlation between the dysfunction caused by the mutation and the dystonic phenotype remain unclear. This review provides an overview of the findings of the last ten years of research on torsinA, a critical evaluation of the different models proposed and insights towards future avenues of research.""","""2009""","[""neuronal functional defect"", ""dystonic"", ""patients"", ""neurodegeneration"", ""torsina"", ""glutamate"", ""primary torsion dystonia"", ""autosomal dominant movement disorder"", ""dyt1"", ""gag"", ""dystonia""]"

Medical treatment rarely relieves symptoms. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of bilateral pallidal stimulation in 6 children and adolescents with primary generalized dystonia. In addition, we strived to find predictors for treatment outcome by review and analysis of previously published studies.<h4>Methods</h4>Six patients with primary generalized dystonia underwent chronic bilateral stimulation of the globus pallidus internus. A PubMed and MEDLINE search was performed in order to identify children and adolescents who underwent deep brain stimulation for primary generalized dystonia. The primary efficacy endpoint was the relative change of the Burke-Fahn-Marsden-Dystonia-Rating-Scale (movement score) after surgery.<h4>Results</h4>Forty-four patients were found to meet the inclusion criteria. The mean age at onset of the disease was 7.8+/-2.8years and the mean age at surgery was 14.2+/-3.5years. The mean Burke-Fahn-Marsden-Dystonia-Rating-Scale (movement score) was 56.9+/-22.7 before surgery and 23.7+/-23.2 at a mean follow up of 13.0+/-4.8months (p<0.001). The improvement in the DYT1-positive group was significantly higher compared to the DYT1-negative group (77%+/-24% and 44%+/-30%, respectively, p<0.001). A positive correlation between the movement score before and after surgery was found in both the DYT1-positive and DYT1-negative cohort (rs=0.624, p<0.001 and rs=0.734, p<0.001, respectively).<h4>Conclusion</h4>DBS is an effective treatment in children and adolescents with primary generalized dystonia.

Among 300 cases with late-onset focal/segmental dystonia, only 3 patients tested positive for the GAG deletion whereas 12.8% of the patients with an unclassified movement disorder were GAG positive. Our results confirm a genotype/phenotype correlation in early-onset PTD and show that application of strict clinical criteria leads to accurate prediction of carrier status in more than two-thirds of patients with this type of dystonia. Currently, we suggest that testing be recommended in individuals with age of onset of dystonia below 30 years and/or a positive family history of early-onset PTD.

Immunofluorescence studies revealed that torsin A localized to a diffuse network of intracellular membranes displaying significant co-immunoreactivity for the endoplasmic reticulum resident protein BiP, whereas DeltaE-torsin A resided in large spheroid intracellular structures exclusive of BiP immunoreactivity. These results initially suggested that DeltaE-torsin A might exist as insoluble aggregates. However, both torsin A and DeltaE-torsin A were readily solubilized by nonionic detergents, were similarly accessible to proteases, and displayed equivalent migration patterns on sucrose gradients. Collectively, these data support that both the wild type and torsion dystonia-associated forms of torsin A are properly folded, lumenal proteins of similar oligomeric states.

Symptoms appear to result from altered neuronal circuitry within the brain with no evidence of neuronal loss. Most cases are caused by loss of a glutamic acid residue in the AAA+ chaperone protein, torsinA, encoded in the DYT1 gene. In this study, torsinA was found to move in conjunction with vimentin in three cell culture paradigms-recovery from microtubule depolymerization, expression of a dominant-negative form of kinesin light chain and respreading after trypsinization. Co-immune precipitation studies revealed association between vimentin and torsinA in a complex including other cytoskeletal elements, actin and tubulin, as well as two proteins previously shown to interact with torsinA-the motor protein, kinesin light chain 1, and the nuclear envelope protein, LAP1. Morphologic and functional differences related to vimentin were noted in primary fibroblasts from patients carrying this DYT1 mutation as compared with controls, including an increased perinuclear concentration of vimentin and a delayed rate of adhesion to the substratum. Overexpression of mutant torsinA inhibited neurite extension in human neuroblastoma cells, with torsinA and vimentin immunoreactivity enriched in the perinuclear region and in cytoplasmic inclusions. Collectively, these studies suggest that mutant torsinA interferes with cytoskeletal events involving vimentin, possibly by restricting movement of these particles/filaments, and hence may affect development of neuronal pathways in the brain.""","""2005""","[""kinesin light chain 1"", ""neuroblastoma"", ""human"", ""patients"", ""lap1"", ""dystonia"", ""torsina"", ""torsion dystonia"", ""movement disorder"", ""autosomal dominant syndrome"", ""neuronal loss"", ""glutamic acid"", ""dyt1"", ""vimentin""]"

One of these, a 3 bp (DeltaGAG) deletion, underlies dominantly inherited cases of early-onset torsion dystonia. Others, including a single nucleotide polymorphism that replaces aspartic acid (D) at residue 216 with histidine (H) in 12% of normal alleles and two other rare deletions, have not been clearly associated with disease. To gain insight into how these sequence variations affect torsinA, we used the structure of the related protein ClpB to provide a model of torsinA's AAA+ domain. Motifs important for ATP hydrolysis-sensor 1 and sensor 2-were identified, mutagenized and used to validate predictions of this model. Inspection revealed that the DeltaGAG deletion associated with dystonia removes one residue from an alpha-helix in the C-terminal portion of the AAA+ domain. The resulting distortion in torsinA structure may underlie this mutant's known tendency to produce ER-derived inclusions as well as its proposed loss of function. The D/H polymorphism at residue 216 falls in the N-terminal portion of the AAA+ domain near the sensor 1 motif. Surprisingly, cells expressing torsinA with the polymorphic histidine developed inclusions similar to those associated with DeltaGAG-torsinA, indicating that this change may also affect torsinA structure. Introducing H216 into DeltaGAG-torsinA reduced its tendency to form inclusions, suggesting that the two changes offset each other. Our findings point to a structural basis for the defects associated with the disease-linked DeltaGAG deletion in torsinA.

The estimated prevalence in the Ashkenazi Jewish population is approximately five to ten times higher, due to a founder mutation. Symptoms of EOTD typically develop first in an arm or leg in middle to late childhood and progress in approximately 30% of patients to other body regions (generalized dystonia) within about five years. Distribution and severity of symptoms vary widely between affected individuals. The majority of cases from various ethnic groups are caused by an autosomal dominantly inherited deletion of 3 bp (GAG) in the DYT1 gene on chromosome 9q34. This gene encodes a protein named torsinA, which is presumed to act as a chaperone protein associated with the endoplasmic reticulum and the nuclear envelope. It may interact with the dopamine transporter and participate in intracellular trafficking, although its precise function within the cell remains to be determined.

In this study, the intracellular localization and levels of endogenous torsin were evaluated in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells following differentiation and stress. TorsinA, apparent MW 37 kDa, cofractionates with markers for the microsomal/endoplasmic reticulum (ER) compartment and appears to reside primarily within the ER lumen based on protease resistance. TorsinA immunoreactivity colocalizes with the lumenal ER protein protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) and extends throughout neurites. Levels of torsinA did not increase notably in response to nerve growth factor-induced differentiation. None of the stress conditions tested, including heat shock and the unfolded protein response, affected torsinA, except for oxidative stress, which resulted in an increase in the apparent MW of torsinA and redistribution to protrusions from the cell surface. These findings are consistent with a relatively rapid covalent modification of torsinA in response to oxidative stress causing a change in state.

Among genetic explanations a major role is attributed to second class HLA genes, with the greatest risk associated with the simultaneous presence of the haplotypes DR3DQ2 and DR4DQ8. Based on results obtained in other countries, the aim of this research is to verify a possible association between the haplotype DRB1 * 04: 05-DQA1 * 03-DQB1 * 02 and the onset of T1DM among Italian children with possible genotype-phenotype correlations. Greater knowledge of genes which increase or decrease susceptibility is important for genome analysis.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>165 patients with type 1 diabetes treated at the Diabetology Unit of the Meyer Children's University Hospital, were clinically analyzed. Data relating to age at diagnosis, pancreatic anti-beta cell autoimmunity, comorbidities with date of diagnosis and family history were retrospectively collected from medical data. A case-control study was conducted to investigate the HLA types of the patients compared to a control group of 819 Tuscan donors enrolled in the National Bone Marrow Donor Register. Typing was carried out using the Eurospital \""DIABEGEN\"" kit, currently in use at the immunology laboratory of the Meyer Children's University Hospital.<h4>Results</h4>Mean age at diagnosis was 9.3 years; most children (97%) had anti-pancreatic beta cell autoimmunity; the anti-insulin antibody (IAA) was more frequent among children with early clinical disease onset (0-5 years of age). From the case control comparison performed on HLA typing, it emerged that the greatest risk for the development of type 1 diabetes is conferred by the haplotypes DR3DQ2 and DR4DQ8, but in addition to these haplotypes, already known in other countries, we identified another haplotype, DR4DQ2 (DRB1 * 04: 05-DQA1 * 03-DQB1 * 02) which appears to predispose children to type 1 diabetes (p value 2.80E-08) and it is associated with early clinical disease onset (p-value = 0.002).<h4>Conclusions</h4>We report a new haplotype which increases susceptibility to type 1 diabetes among Italian children and which is associated with early clinical disease onset. Given the central role attributed to genetic factors in the pathogenesis of T1DM and to the II class HLA genes, this new haplotype ought to be recognized as a risk factor and included in tests routinely carried out to identify patients with a genetic predisposition to type I diabetes in Italy.

Previous work on torsinA has shown that it localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum, where there is evidence that it plays roles in protein trafficking, and potentially also protein folding. Given the high level of evolutionary conservation among proteins involved in these processes, the ability of human such proteins to function effectively in yeast, as well as the previous successes achieved in examining other proteins involved in complex human diseases in yeast, we hypothesized that Saccharomyces cerevisiae might represent a useful model system for studying torsinA function and the effects of its mutants. Since torsinA is proposed to function in protein homeostasis, we tested cells for their ability to respond to various stressors, using a fluorescent reporter to measure the unfolded protein response, as well as their rate of protein secretion. TorsinA did not impact these processes, even after co-expression of its recently identified interacting partner, printor. In light of these findings, we propose that yeast may lack an additional cofactor necessary for torsinA function or proteins required for essential post-translational modifications of torsinA. Alternatively, torsinA may not function in endoplasmic reticulum protein homeostasis.

Thus far, no studies have examined the chaperone activity of torsinA in vitro. Here we expressed and purified both wild-type (WT) and mutant torsinA fusion proteins in bacteria and examined their ability to function as molecular chaperones by monitoring suppression of luciferase and citrate synthase (CS) aggregation. We also assessed their ability to hold proteins in an intermediate state for refolding. As measured by light scattering and SDS-PAGE, both WT and mutant torsinA effectively, and similarly, suppressed protein aggregation compared to controls. This function was not further enhanced by the presence of ATP. Further, we found that while neither form of torsinA could protect CS from heat-induced inactivation, they were both able to reactivate luciferase when ATP and rabbit reticulocyte lysate were added. This suggests that torsinA holds luciferase in an intermediate state, which can then be refolded in the presence of other chaperones. These data provide conclusive evidence that torsinA acts as a molecular chaperone in vitro and suggests that early-onset torsion dystonia is likely not a consequence of a loss in torsinA chaperone activity but might be an outcome of insufficient torsinA localization at the ER to manage protein folding or trafficking.""","""2010""","[""atp"", ""protein aggregation"", ""sds"", ""cs"", ""citrate synthase"", ""torsina"", ""movement disorder"", ""torsion dystonia""]"

Although there is increasing evidence that dysfunction of the dopamine system is implicated in the development of EOTD, the biological function of torsinA and its relation to dopaminergic neurotransmission has remained unexplored. Here, we show that torsinA can regulate the cellular trafficking of the dopamine transporter, as well as other polytopic membrane-bound proteins, including G protein-coupled receptors, transporters, and ion channels. This effect was prevented by mutating the ATP-binding site in torsinA. The dystonia-associated torsinA deletion mutant (DeltaE-torsinA) did not have any effect on the cell surface distribution of polytopic membrane-associated proteins, suggesting that the mutation linked with EOTD results in a loss of function.

In contrast, expression of either dystonia-associated mutant torsinA or combined overexpression of wild-type and mutant torsinA yielded greatly diminished neuroprotection against 6-OHDA. We further demonstrated that torsins seem to protect DA neurons from 6-OHDA through downregulating protein levels of the dopamine transporter (DAT-1) in vivo. Additionally, we determined that torsins protect robustly against DA neurodegeneration caused by overexpression of alpha-synuclein. Using mutant nematodes lacking DAT-1 function, we also showed that torsin neuroprotection from alpha-synuclein-induced degeneration occurs in a manner independent of this transporter.

We assessed clinical features in 786 ITD patients and determined the relative frequencies of various clinical forms of ITD in the major ethnic groups. Several differences in age-at-onset and site-at-onset distributions among groups were demonstrated. As expected, Ashkenazi Jews had an earlier age-at-onset distribution than did non-Jewish Caucasians. In the early-onset group, Jews were less likely to have cervical onset and more likely to have onset in the limbs than were non-Jewish Caucasians (p < 0.01). Among late-onset cases, Jews had less cervical onset and more cranial onset than did non-Jewish Caucasians (p < 0.01). African-Americans showed suggestive differences in both age at onset and site at onset as compared with the two caucasian groups, with an intermediate age at onset, a deficit of leg onset, and an excess of cranial and larynx onset. Subgroups of non-Jewish Caucasians showed no significant differences from each other.

Two neurologists reviewed the videotaped examination and rated the severity and constancy of dystonia, calculating a total dystonia score for each patient.<h4>Results</h4>Prevalence of dystonia of any severity was 95.2%. Twenty-four of 42 (57.1%) had dystonia in at least one body region that was moderate and present more than half of the time, and seven of 42 (16.7%) had dystonia that was severe and constant.

In this study we describe 5 new patients who fulfilled the criteria for the diagnosis of delayed-onset dystonia due to perinatal asphyxia (Tables 1 and 2). We accepted the approach of Saint-Hilaire et al. to suggest a relationship between perinatal asphyxia and later occurrence of dystonia in our 5 patients. However, coincident occurrence of a primary dystonia with a static encephalopathy of childhood due to perinatal asphyxia cannot be excluded. This phenomenon of delayed appearance of dystonia was also described in other forms of static cerebral injury; i.e. stroke, head trauma or anoxic brain damage. Interestingly enough, age at the time of anoxia or brain insults seemed to be crucial for the development of dystonia: those who suffer acute brain insults during childhood or early life are more likely to develop dystonia than the older patients. Therefore, the \""static\"" nature of encephalopathy induced by perinatal asphyxia is questionable. Finally, this study strengthens the suggestion that perinatal asphyxia can lead to delayed-onset dystonia, and, since \""some of these patients closely resemble cases of idiopathic torsion dystonia, the prior occurrence of asphyxia should be used as a criterion of exclusion for that diagnosis\"".""","""1997""","[""idiopathic torsion dystonia"", ""anoxia"", ""head trauma or anoxic brain damage"", ""static cerebral injury"", ""baclofen"", ""trihexyphenidyl"", ""achievements of developmental milestones"", ""patient"", ""hemidystonia"", ""brachial dystonia"", ""movement disorders"", ""patients"", ""encephalopathy"", ""neurological deficit"", ""asphyxia"", ""head trauma"", ""stroke"", ""brain injuries"", ""dystonia""]"

There was a buccolingual hyskinesia in another of these 11 patients, but this may have been related to her previous drug regime. In the twelfth patient, who had a familial tremor, the voice was characterised by marked breathiness, with intermittent aphonia.

Based on the fact that dopamine-beta-hydroxylase levels are frequently elevated in patients with the dominant form of torsion dystonia it is suggested that dystonia results from impairment of a normal dopaminergic-noradrenergic balance, in which noradrenergic tone preponderates. A relative norepinephrine hyperactivity may be caused by dopaminergic blockade (as occurs in drug-induced dystonia) or from enhanced release of norepinephrine (in idiopathic torsion dystonia).""","""1978""","[""idiopathic torsion dystonia"", ""hyperactivity"", ""norepinephrine"", ""dystonia"", ""torsion dystonia"", ""patients"", ""dopamine-beta-hydroxylase"", ""tetrabenazine"", ""reserpine"", ""dopamine""]"

In the present study, we show that the antihistamine properties of diphenhydramine may contribute to its beneficial effects. Acute dystonic reactions were produced in rats with unilateral microinjection of haloperidol into the red nucleus as previously described. Similar to the pattern in humans, this effect could be attenuated by coadministration of diphenhydramine. Unilateral microinjection of histamine itself into the rat red nucleus produced dystonic postures (torticollis) in a dose-dependent manner, demonstrating that a histamine dysfunction could contribute to the pathophysiology of dystonia. The torticollis produced by histamine could be significantly attenuated with coadministration of the H1 antagonists diphenhydramine or pyrilamine or the H2 antagonist cimetidine. These effects are thought to be mediated through the red nucleus because significantly more torticollis was observed when histamine was injected into the red nucleus rather than surrounding mid-brain areas, the substantia nigra, or the lateral ventricle. The present data, taken together with studies in humans, suggest the involvement of histamine in some types of dystonia.

Although Clp/Hsp100 and AAA family proteins have roles in diverse cellular activities, many are involved in the assembly or disassembly of proteins or protein complexes; thus, OOC-5 may function as a chaperone. OOC-5 protein co-localizes with a marker of the endoplasmic reticulum in all blastomeres of the early C. elegans embryo, in a pattern indistinguishable from that of OOC-3 protein. Furthermore, OOC-5 localization depends on the normal function of the ooc-3 gene.

Substance P, a member of the tachykinin family of neuropeptides, is a major component in the direct pathway from striatum to basal ganglia output nuclei. In the present study quantitative autoradiography was used to examine changes in neurokinin-1 (NK-1) and neurokinin-3 (NK-3) receptors in mutant dystonic hamsters (dt(sz)), a well characterized model of paroxysmal dystonia. NK-1 receptors were labeled in 10 dystonic brains and 10 age-matched controls with 3 nM [(3)H]-[Sar(9), Met(O(2))(11)]-SP. NK-3 binding sites were labeled in adjacent sections with 2.5 nM [(3)H]senktide. NK-1 binding was found to be unaltered in 27 brain areas examined. In contrast, NK-3 binding was significantly reduced in layers 4 and 5 of the prefrontal (-46%), anterior cingulate (-42%) and parietal (-45%) cortices, ventromedial thalamus (-42%) and substantia nigra pars compacta (-36%) in dystonic brains compared to controls. The latter effects may be particularly relevant in view of evidence that activation of NK-3 receptors on dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta can increase nigrostriatal dopaminergic activity. Since previous studies indicated that a reduced basal ganglia output in mutant hamsters is based on an overactivity of the direct pathway which also innervates substantia nigra pars compacta neurons, the decreased NK-3 binding could be related to a receptor down-regulation. The present finding of decreased NK-3 receptor density in the substantia nigra pars compacta, thalamic and cortical areas substantiates the hypothesis that disturbances of the basal ganglia-thalamus-cortex circuit play a critical role in the pathogenesis of paroxysmal dystonia.""","""2002""","[""sar"", ""dystonic brains"", ""paroxysmal dystonia"", ""dystonic"", ""primary dystonias"", ""hamster""]"

Primary dystonia includes syndromes in which dystonia is the sole phenotypic manifestation with the exception that tremor can be present as well. Primary dystonias are typically mobile and may show task specificity. Fixed dystonias are often psychogenic or associated with complex regional pain syndrome. Fixed dystonia may also be the terminal consequence of long-standing, inadequately-treated, severe appendicular or cervical dystonia. The vast majority of primary dystonias have their onset in adults. Late-onset, primary, focal dystonia, particularly blepharospasm, may spread to affect other anatomical segments. Patients with focal dystonia may also exhibit spontaneous remissions that last for years. Although sensory tricks are commonly reported by patients with primary dystonia, they have also been described in subjects with secondary dystonia. Another important sensory aspect of dystonia is pain which is relatively common in cervical dystonia but also reported by many patients with masticatory dystonia, hand-forearm dystonia and blepharospasm.

Structural analysis predicted a functionally inactive status of this truncated torsinA due to the loss of residues associated with ATPase activity and binding to LULL1. Immunoblotting showed a reduction of the torsinA protein level in Cas9-edited DYT1 fibroblasts, and a functional assay using HSV infection indicated a phenotypic recovery toward that observed in control fibroblasts. These findings suggest that the selective disruption of the mutant TOR1A allele using CRISPR-Cas9 inactivates mutant torsinA, allowing the remaining wild-type torsinA to exert normal function.""","""2020""","[""torsina"", ""dyt1"", ""tor1a"", ""crispr"", ""neurologic"", ""dystonia"", ""herpes simplex virus type 1"", ""hereditary"", ""nuclear envelope"", ""gene therapy""]"

Here, we report two new, putative TOR1A mutations (p.A14_P15del and p.E121K) that we examined functionally in comparison with wild-type (WT) protein and two known mutations (ΔE and p.R288Q). While inclusion formation is a characteristic feature for ΔE TOR1A, elevated levels of aggregates for other mutations were not observed when compared with WT TOR1A. WT and mutant TOR1A showed preferred degradation through the autophagy-lysosome pathway, which is most pronounced for p.A14_P15del, p.R288Q, and ΔE TOR1A. Notably, blocking of the autophagy pathway with bafilomycin resulted in a significant increase in inclusion formation in p.E121K TOR1A. In addition, all variants had an influence on protein stability. Although the p.A14_P15del mutation affects the proposed oligomerization domain of TOR1A, this mutation did not disturb the ability to dimerize.

Previous reports have suggested that torsin 1A, a protein mutated in this disease, might function as a chaperone that prevents the toxic aggregation of misfolded polypeptides. The aim of the study: The aim of this study was to verify the chaperone function of torsin 1A by investigating its ability to prevent the aggregation of huntingtin model peptides.<h4>Patients and methods</h4>Materials and methods: N-terminal mutant huntingtin fragments of different length were co-expressed in neuronal HT-22 and non-neuronal HeLa cells with either the wild-type or mutant (ΔE302/303) torsin 1A protein. The transfected cells were immunostained and analyzed for the presence of huntingtin aggregates using fluorescence microscopy.<h4>Results</h4>Results: The immunofluorescence analysis of huntingtin subcellular distribution within the transfected cells showed no significant difference between the huntingtin aggregation levels in cells co-expressing the wild-type torsin 1A and in control cells co-transfected with an empty vector. Instead, it was the increased level of huntingtin aggregation in the presence of the torsion dystonia-causing ΔE302/303 mutant that reached statistical significance in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Conclusions: Either torsin 1A does not function as a chaperone protein or huntingtin is not an efficient substrate for such a hypothetical chaperone activity. However, the ability of mutant torsin 1A to stimulate the accumulation of aggregation-prone polypeptides might constitute an important source of ΔE302/303 pathogenicity and thus a potential target for future therapy.""","""2018""","[""torsin 1a"", ""chaperone proteins"", ""torsion dystonia"", ""tor1a"", ""huntingtin"", ""protein aggregation""]"
"""20301665""","""DYT1 Early-Onset Isolated Dystonia""","""<h4>Clinical characteristics</h4>DYT1 early-onset isolated dystonia typically presents in childhood or adolescence and only on occasion in adulthood. Dystonic muscle contractions causing posturing or irregular tremor of a leg or arm are the most common presenting findings. Dystonia is usually first apparent with specific actions such as writing or walking. Over time, the contractions frequently (but not invariably) become evident with less specific actions and spread to other body regions. No other neurologic abnormalities are present. Disease severity varies considerably even within the same family. Isolated writer's cramp may be the only sign.<h4>Diagnosis/testing</h4>The diagnosis of DYT1 dystonia is established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous TOR1A pathogenic variant on molecular genetic testing. A TOR1A three base-pair deletion, c.907_909delGAG, is identified in most affected individuals.<h4>Management</h4>Treatment of manifestations: Oral medications, either alone or in combination, are usually tried first, including anticholinergics, baclofen, benzodiazepines, and others. Botulinum toxin injections for treatment of focal symptoms can be used in conjunction with oral medications. If oral medications and botulinum toxin injections do not provide sufficient control of symptoms, surgery enabling deep-brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus interna (GPi) should be considered. Prevention of secondary complications: Aggressive medical and surgical intervention to prevent contractures of the joints and deformities of the spine. Surveillance: Follow up with a neurologist specializing in movement disorders several times a year. Agents/circumstances to avoid: The extremities affected by dystonia should not be placed in a brace or cast, unless medically necessary, as this can worsen the dystonia.<h4>Genetic counseling</h4>DYT1 dystonia is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner with reduced penetrance. Offspring of an affected individual or of an asymptomatic individual known to have a TOR1A pathogenic variant have a 50% chance of inheriting the variant and if inherited a 30% chance of developing clinical findings. Once the TOR1A c.907_909delGAG deletion has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing for DYT1 dystonia are possible.""","""2016""","[""dyt1 early-onset isolated dystonia"", ""oppenheim's dystonia"", ""torsin-1a"", ""early-onset torsion dystonia"", ""tor1a""]"

It is caused mainly by a heterozygous trinucleotide deletion in DYT1/TOR1A, coding for torsinA. The mutation may lead to a partial loss of torsinA function. Functional alterations of the basal ganglia circuits have been implicated in this disease. Striatal dopamine receptor 2 (D2R) levels are significantly decreased in DYT1 dystonia patients and in the animal models of DYT1 dystonia. D2R-expressing cells, such as the medium spiny neurons in the indirect pathway, striatal cholinergic interneurons, and dopaminergic neurons in the basal ganglia circuits, contribute to motor performance. However, the function of torsinA in these neurons and its contribution to the motor symptoms is not clear. Here, D2R-expressing-cell-specific Dyt1 conditional knockout (d2KO) mice were generated and in vivo effects of torsinA loss in the corresponding cells were examined. The Dyt1 d2KO mice showed significant reductions of striatal torsinA, acetylcholine metabolic enzymes, Tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA), and cholinergic interneurons. The Dyt1 d2KO mice also showed significant reductions of striatal D2R dimers and tyrosine hydroxylase without significant alteration in striatal monoamine contents or the number of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. The Dyt1 d2KO male mice showed motor deficits in the accelerated rotarod and beam-walking tests without overt dystonic symptoms. Moreover, the Dyt1 d2KO male mice showed significant correlations between striatal monoamines and locomotion. The results suggest that torsinA in the D2R-expressing cells play a critical role in the development or survival of the striatal cholinergic interneurons, expression of striatal D2R mature form, and motor performance.

DYT1 dystonia is likely a network disorder involving multiple brain regions, particularly the basal ganglia. Tor1a conditional knockout in the striatum or cerebral cortex leads to motor deficits, suggesting the importance of corticostriatal connection in the pathogenesis of dystonia. Indeed, corticostriatal long-term depression impairment has been demonstrated in multiple targeted DYT1 mouse models. Pappas and colleagues developed a conditional knockout line (Dlx-CKO) that inactivated Tor1a in the forebrain and surprisingly displayed overt dystonia. We set out to validate whether conditional knockout affecting both cortex and striatum would lead to overt dystonia and whether machine learning-based video behavioral analysis could be used to facilitate high throughput preclinical drug screening. We generated Dlx-CKO mice and found no overt dystonia or motor deficits at 4 months. At 8 months, retesting revealed motor deficits in rotarod, beam walking, grip strength, and hyperactivity in the open field; however, no overt dystonia was visually discernible or through the machine learning-based video analysis.

It is caused by a heterozygous mutation in <i>Torsin A</i> (<i>TOR1A</i>), a gene encoding a membrane-embedded ATPase. While animal models provide insights into disease mechanisms, significant species-dependent differences exist since animals with the identical heterozygous mutation fail to show pathology. Here, we model DYT1 by using human patient-specific cholinergic motor neurons (MNs) that are generated through either direct conversion of patients' skin fibroblasts or differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). These human MNs with the heterozygous <i>TOR1A</i> mutation show reduced neurite length and branches, markedly thickened nuclear lamina, disrupted nuclear morphology, and impaired nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT) of mRNAs and proteins, whereas they lack the perinuclear \""blebs\"" that are often observed in animal models. Furthermore, we uncover that the nuclear lamina protein LMNB1 is upregulated in DYT1 cells and exhibits abnormal subcellular distribution in a cholinergic MNs-specific manner. Such dysregulation of LMNB1 can be recapitulated by either ectopic expression of the mutant <i>TOR1A</i> gene or shRNA-mediated downregulation of endogenous <i>TOR1A</i> in healthy control MNs. Interestingly, downregulation of LMNB1 can largely ameliorate all the cellular defects in DYT1 MNs.

Autosomal dominant torsion dystonia-1 is a disease with incomplete penetrance most often caused by an in-frame GAG deletion (p.Glu303del) in the endoplasmic reticulum luminal protein torsinA encoded by TOR1A. We report an association of the homozygous dominant disease-causing TOR1A p.Glu303del mutation, and a novel homozygous missense variant (p.Gly318Ser) with a severe arthrogryposis phenotype with developmental delay, strabismus and tremor in three unrelated Iranian families. All parents who were carriers of the TOR1A variant showed no evidence of neurological symptoms or signs, indicating decreased penetrance similar to families with autosomal dominant torsion dystonia-1. The results from cell assays demonstrate that the p.Gly318Ser substitution causes a redistribution of torsinA from the endoplasmic reticulum to the nuclear envelope, similar to the hallmark of the p.Glu303del mutation. Our study highlights that TOR1A mutations should be considered in patients with severe arthrogryposis and further expands the phenotypic spectrum associated with TOR1A mutations.""","""2017""","[""tor1a"", ""endoplasmic reticulum luminal protein torsina"", ""severe arthrogryposis"", ""tor1a p.glu303del"", ""dyt1 dystonia""]"

To date, the effect of ΔE on torsinA and the reason that this mutation results in EOTD are unclear. Moreover, there are no specific therapeutic options to treat EOTD. To define the underlying biochemical defects associated with torsinAΔE and to uncover factors that might be targeted to offset defects associated with torsinAΔE, we developed a yeast torsinA expression system and tested the roles of ER chaperones in mediating the folding and stability of torsinA and torsinAΔE. We discovered that the ER lumenal Hsp70, BiP, an associated Hsp40, Scj1, and a nucleotide exchange factor, Lhs1, stabilize torsinA and torsinAΔE. BiP also maintained torsinA and torsinAΔE solubility. Mutations predicted to compromise specific torsinA functional motifs showed a synthetic interaction with the ΔE mutation and destabilized torsinAΔE, suggesting that the ΔE mutation predisposes torsinA to defects in the presence of secondary insults. In this case, BiP was required for torsinAΔE degradation, consistent with data that specific chaperones exhibit either pro-degradative or pro-folding activities. Finally, using two independent approaches, we established that BiP stabilizes torsinA and torsinAΔE in mammalian cells.

While it is clear that Torsins have essential roles in many, if not all metazoans, their precise cellular functions remain elusive. Studying Torsins has significant medical relevance since mutations in Torsins or Torsin-associated proteins result in a variety of congenital human disorders, the most frequent of which is early-onset torsion (DYT1) dystonia, a severe movement disorder. A better understanding of the Torsin system is needed to define the molecular etiology of these diseases, potentially enabling corrective therapy.

One of the most severe types of dystonia is early-onset torsion dystonia (EOTD). The best studied and validated EOTD-associated mutation, torsinAΔE, is a deletion of a C-terminal glutamate residue in the AAA+ ATPase torsinA. TorsinA appears to be an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/nuclear envelope chaperone with multiple roles in the secretory pathway and in determining subcellular architecture. Many functions are disabled in the torsinAΔE variant, and torsinAΔE is also less stable than wild-type torsinA and is a substrate for ER-associated degradation. Nevertheless, the molecular factors involved in the biogenesis and degradation of torsinA and torsinAΔE have not been fully explored. To identify conserved cellular factors that can alter torsinAΔE protein levels, we designed a new high-throughput, automated, genome-wide screen utilizing our validated <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> torsinA expression system. By analyzing the yeast non-essential gene deletion collection, we identified 365 deletion strains with altered torsinAΔE steady-state levels. One notable hit was <i>EUG1</i>, which encodes a member of the protein disulfide isomerase family (PDIs). PDIs reside in the ER and catalyze the formation of disulfide bonds, mediate protein quality control and aid in nascent protein folding. We validated the role of select human PDIs in torsinA biogenesis in mammalian cells and found that overexpression of PDIs reduced the levels of torsinA and torsinAΔE. Together, our data report the first genome-wide screen to identify cellular factors that alter expression levels of the EOTD-associated protein torsinAΔE. More generally, the identified hits help in dissecting the cellular machinery involved in folding and degrading a torsinA variant, and constitute potential therapeutic factors for EOTD.

While the aberrant deposition of FG-Nups is caused by defective nuclear pore complex assembly, the source of K48-ubiquitylated proteins inside NE blebs is not known. Here, we demonstrate that the characteristic K48-ubiquitin accumulation inside blebs requires p97 activity. This activity is highly dependent on the p97 adaptor UBXD1. We show that p97 does not significantly depend on the Ufd1/Npl4 heterodimer to generate the K48-ubiquitylated proteins inside blebs, nor does inhibiting translation affect the ubiquitin sequestration in blebs. However, stimulating global ubiquitylation by heat shock greatly increases the amount of K48-ubiquitin sequestered inside blebs. These results suggest that blebs have an extraordinarily high capacity for sequestering ubiquitylated protein generated in a p97-dependent manner.

Because striatal cholinergic neurotransmission mediates dopamine release, it is not known if the dopamine release deficit is mediated indirectly by abnormal acetylcholine neurotransmission or if Tor1a(ΔE) acts directly within dopaminergic neurons to attenuate release. To dissect the microcircuit that governs the deficit in dopamine release, we conditionally expressed Tor1a(ΔE) in either dopamine neurons or cholinergic interneurons in mice and assessed striatal dopamine release using ex vivo fast scan cyclic voltammetry or dopamine efflux using in vivo microdialysis.

Here, we used the glycoprotein torsinA as a model substrate to explore the impact of ER redox homeostasis on PTMs and protein biogenesis.

We now know that homozygosity for ΔGAG has the same effects as Tor1a<sup>KO</sup> , implicating a partial loss of function mechanism in the ΔGAG/+ disease state. In addition, torsinA loss specifically affects neurons in mice, even though the gene is broadly expressed, apparently because of differential expression of homologous torsinB. Furthermore, certain neuronal subtypes are more severely affected by torsinA loss. Interestingly, these include striatal cholinergic interneurons that display abnormal responses to dopamine in several Tor1a animal models. There is also progress on understanding torsinA molecular cell biology. The structural basis of how ΔGAG inhibits torsinA ATPase activity is defined, although mutant torsinA<sup>ΔGAG</sup> protein also displays some characteristics suggesting it contributes to dystonia by a gain-of-function mechanism. Furthermore, a consistent relationship is emerging between torsin dysfunction and membrane biology, including an evolutionarily conserved regulation of lipid metabolism. Considered together, these findings provide major advances toward understanding the molecular, cellular, and neurobiological pathologies of DYT1/TOR1A dystonia that can hopefully be exploited for new approaches to treat this disease. © 2016 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.""","""2016""","[""membrane"", ""torsina"", ""endoplasmic reticulum"", ""dystonia"", ""nuclear envelope""]"

The LINC complex spans the nuclear envelope and mediates nuclear mechanotransduction, the process by which mechanical signals and forces are transmitted across the nuclear envelope. In turn, the AAA+ ATPase torsinA is thought to regulate force transmission from the cytoskeleton to the nucleus. In humans, mutations affecting nuclear envelope-associated proteins cause laminopathies, including progeria, myopathy, and dystonia, though the extent to which endogenous mechanical stresses contribute to these pathologies is unclear. Here, we use the <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> germline as a model to investigate mechanisms that maintain nuclear integrity as germ cell nuclei progress through meiotic development and migrate for gametogenesis-processes that require LINC complex function. We report that decreasing the function of the <i>C. elegans</i> torsinA homolog, OOC-5, rescues the sterility and premature aging caused by a null mutation in the single worm lamin homolog. We show that decreasing OOC-5/torsinA activity prevents nuclear collapse in lamin mutants by disrupting the function of the LINC complex. At a mechanistic level, OOC-5/torsinA promotes the assembly or maintenance of the lamin-associated LINC complex and this activity is also important for interphase nuclear pore complex insertion into growing germline nuclei. These results demonstrate that LINC complex-transmitted forces damage nuclei with a compromised nuclear lamina. Thus, the torsinA-LINC complex nexus might comprise a therapeutic target for certain laminopathies by preventing damage from endogenous cellular forces.""","""2020""","[""torsina"", ""nuclear mechanotransduction"", ""nuclear lamina"", ""laminopathy"", ""linc complex""]"

To test this hypothesis, we performed proteomic analysis on nuclear and cytosolic subcellular fractions from DYT-TOR1A and wildtype mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). We further examined the compartmental proteomes following exposure to thapsigargin (Tg), an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stressor, because DYT-TOR1A dystonia models have previously shown abnormalities in cellular stress responses. Across both subcellular compartments, proteomes of DYT-TOR1A cells showed basal state disruptions consistent with an activated stress response, and in response to thapsigargin, a blunted stress response.

Symptoms typically appear during childhood, suggesting the presence of an early critical period of sensorimotor circuit susceptibility to torsinA dysfunction.

By means of immunofluorescence, confocal analysis and western blot quantification, we observed a reduced inhibitory input on Purkinje cells (PCs) as well as an unbalanced excitatory innervation; a significant reduction of the parallel fiber (PF) synaptic terminals and an increase of the climbing fiber (CF) inputs. Finally, in support of the in vivo results, we also provide evidence of an impaired PF synaptogenesis in a co-culture system. Of note, these alterations were rescued and in part over-compensated in the adult age in both mouse strains, suggesting that torsinA dysfunction can induce an altered maturation of cerebellar synaptic contacts.

While 15 individuals with AMC5-TOR1A have been reported (less than 10 in detail), a systematic investigation of the full disease-associated spectrum has not been conducted. Here, we assess the clinical, radiological and molecular characteristics of 57 individuals from 40 families with biallelic variants in TOR1A. Median age at last follow-up was 3 years (0-24 years). Most individuals presented with severe congenital flexion contractures (95%) and variable developmental delay (79%). Motor symptoms were reported in 79% and included lower limb spasticity and pyramidal signs, as well as gait disturbances. Facial dysmorphism was an integral part of the phenotype, with key features being a broad/full nasal tip, narrowing of the forehead and full cheeks. Analysis of disease-associated manifestations delineated a phenotypic spectrum ranging from normal cognition and mild gait disturbance to congenital arthrogryposis, global developmental delay, intellectual disability, absent speech and inability to walk. In a subset, the presentation was consistent with foetal akinesia deformation sequence with severe intrauterine abnormalities. Survival was 71%, with higher mortality in males. Death occurred at a median age of 1.2 months (1 week-9 years), due to respiratory failure, cardiac arrest or sepsis. Analysis of brain MRI studies identified non-specific neuroimaging features, including a hypoplastic corpus callosum (72%), foci of signal abnormality in the subcortical and periventricular white matter (55%), diffuse white matter volume loss (45%), mega cisterna magna (36%) and arachnoid cysts (27%). The molecular spectrum included 22 distinct variants, defining a mutational hotspot in the C-terminal domain of the Torsin-1A protein. Genotype-phenotype analysis revealed an association of missense variants in the 3-helix bundle domain to an attenuated phenotype, while missense variants near the Walker A/B motif as well as biallelic truncating variants were linked to early death.

Dystonia has traditionally been considered a disorder of the basal ganglia. However, growing evidence suggests that the cerebellum may be involved in certain types of dystonia, raising several questions. Can different types of dystonia be classified as either a basal ganglia disorder or a cerebellar disorder? Is dystonia a network disorder that involves the cerebellum and basal ganglia? If dystonia is a network disorder, how can we target treatments to alleviate symptoms in patients? A recent study by Chen et al, using the pharmacological mouse model of rapid-onset dystonia parkinsonism, has provided some insight into these important questions. They showed that the cerebellum can directly modulate basal ganglia activity through a short latency cerebello-thalamo-basal ganglia pathway. Further, this article and others have provided evidence that in some cases, aberrant cerebello-basal ganglia communication can be involved in dystonia. In this review we examine the evidence for the involvement of the cerebellum and cerebello-basal ganglia interactions in dystonia. We conclude that there is ample evidence to suggest that the cerebellum plays a role in some dystonias, including the early-onset primary torsion dystonia DYT1 and that further studies examining the role of this brain region and its interaction with the basal ganglia in dystonia are warranted. © 2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.""","""2017""","[""dystonia"", ""basal ganglia"", ""cerebellum"", ""dyt1"", ""rapid onset dystonia parkinsonism"", ""movement disorders""]"

Globus pallidus interna deep brain stimulation (GPi-DBS) has been shown to provide significant improvement in these cases.<h4>Methods</h4>This was a retrospective study of TOR1A mutation positive dystonia patients, conducted at a university hospital from 2006 to 2018. Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale (BFM-DRS) was used to evaluate dystonia severity before and after surgery. Emergence of postsurgical parkinsonian symptoms was evaluated using the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) part III. Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) was applied to assess cognitive dysfunction. SPSS version 18 was used for data analysis.<h4>Results</h4>Eleven patients entered for analysis with an average age of 22.36 (±3.35) years (range: 18-28). Seven patients (63.6 %) were female. Mean follow-up period was 8.72 (±0.87). Difference between baseline and most recent BFM scores was significant (disability: 10.5 ±4.52 versus 2.09 (±3.20), P: 0.001; severity: 48.45 (±17.88) versus 9.36 (±10.47), P<0.001). The mean MOCA and UPDRS III scores after 7-9 years of DBS were 27.18 (±2.99), and 6.09 (±4.15), respectively.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our experience confirms that GPi-DBS in pediatric patients with DYT1 dystonia is overall successful, with significant and long-lasting positive effects on motor and cognitive functions.

Methods: The clinical data of 9 children with SGCE-related myoclonus dystonia syndrome admitted at either the Department of Neurology, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University or the Department of Pediatrics, Peking University First Hospital from May 2018 to October 2019 were collected and the patients were followed up. The definite diagnosis was made on the basis of whole exome sequencing and multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification. The clinical features and gene test results were analyzed retrospectively. Results: Data of 9 patients (4 boys and 5 girls) diagnosed as myoclonus dystonia syndrome caused by SGCE variants were collected. The onset age ranged from 1 year to 3 years and 2 months. The first symptom was myoclonus in 4 cases, while dystonia in the remaining 5 cases. In the course of the disease, 9 cases had myoclonus and 8 had dystonia. Myoclonic jerks were characterized by involuntary jerks in both upper limbs in 8 patients. Six patients had involuntary jerks of lower limbs, resulting in gait instability or even falling. The myoclonus was exacerbated during the fine motor activities, emotional stress or fatigue. Dystonia was characterized by abnormal gait, including 5 cases with right leg dystonia, and 3 cases with the left leg dystonia. Three probands had a positive family history. Intellectual development was normal in all cases. There was no obvious abnormality in video-electroencephalogram (EEG) during both ictal and interictal periods. Electromyography (EMG) and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of 9 patients were normal. Nine patients carried SGCE gene variants, including 3 frame shift variants, 2 nonsense variants, 2 missense variants, 1 fragment deletion variant and 1 splice site variant. Seven variants were inherited paternally, and 2 variants were de novo. Madopar was used in 8 patients, and nitrazepam in 4 patients, leading to the decrease in the myoclonus jerks and improvement of gait in 6 and 2 patients, respectively. Conclusions: SGCE gene variants can cause myoclonus dystonia syndrome. The onset of the disease may occur at infancy or preschool age, with either myoclonic jerks or dystonia as the initial symptom. Non-epileptic myoclonus is the prominent symptom, with upper limb mainly involved. Most of the patients have the accompanying symptoms of dystonia, and some of them may have spontaneous symptom relief. SGCE gene is imprinted maternally, and the inherited variants of SGCE are paternal in origin.""","""2020""","[""genes, sgce"", ""dystonia musculorum deformans"", ""imprinting gene"", ""myoclonus""]"

In recent years, many new candidate genes are being identified as putative pathogenic factors in children with isolated dystonia due to the easy availability of whole-exome sequencing. Recently biallelic mutations in the COL6A3 gene were identified as a cause of rare dystonia (DYT)-27 syndrome. Till date, only six cases of DYT27 have been reported in the literature. METHODS:We report a new case of COL6A3 mutation associated early-onset isolated dystonia-DYT27. We did a review of the previously published cases of DYT27. Citations were identified through PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Google scholar searches using the search terms (including variations), \""Dystonia-27 or DYT27\"" or/and \""COL6A3 mutation associated early-onset isolated dystonia\"", combined with study filters for original research, case reports and case series. RESULTS:Next-generation sequencing in the index patient revealed two pathogenic compound heterozygous loss of function mutations in exon 10 and exon 12 of the COL6A3 gene coding for the alpha(α)3(VI) chain of type VI collagen. Together with the presented case, seven cases (five males) were available for analysis. The median age at onset was 22 years (range: 6-61). Dystonic symptoms were started from hands in five and from the neck in the remaining two patients. Five patients had favorable outcomes with trihexyphenidyl and botulinum toxin while tetrabenazine and levodopa were ineffective. CONCLUSIONS:Although it is a new entity that is only recently discovered, in future years many more new cases suffering from this particular entity are likely to be reported and the already heterogeneous clinical spectrum is likely to be further widespread in years to come.""","""2020""","[""col6a3 gene"", ""early-onset primary dystonia"", ""dyt27"", ""primary dystonia"", ""oromandibular dystonia""]"
"""26596547""","""Genetic mutations strengthen functional association of LAP1 with DYT1 dystonia and muscular dystrophy.""","""Lamina-associated polypeptide 1 (LAP1) is a ubiquitously expressed integral protein of the inner nuclear membrane. It interacts physically with lamins, torsinA, emerin and protein phosphatase 1; potentially providing a pivotal mechanism for transducing signals across the inner nuclear membrane. In neurons a functional protein complex is formed, comprising LAP1 and torsinA and in skeletal muscle LAP1 and emerin likewise form a protein complex. Several isoforms of LAP1 have been reported across species. However, in humans only two isoforms have been described, LAP1B and LAP1C. The latter has only recently been reported, but its physiological function and mode of action are not clear. The first TOR1AIP1 (gene encoding LAP1) mutation identified is a single nucleotide deletion resulting in a frameshift and a putative truncated LAP1B protein (Turkish mutation). This has deleterious effects associated with a specific form of muscular dystrophy. A second point mutation, affecting both human LAP1 isoforms, was also recently described. This mutation involves the replacement of a single glutamic acid to alanine at position 482 (Moroccan Mutation), thereby causing severe dystonia, cerebellar atrophy and cardiomyopathy. This review focuses on the recently described human LAP1 isoform (LAP1C), the two recently reported LAP1 mutations and post-translational LAP1 modifications. The latter play an important role in regulating this protein. These scientific contributions strengthen the role of LAP1 in DYT1 dystonia and muscular dystrophy.""","""2015""","[""torsin a"", ""lamina associated polypeptide 1"", ""emerin"", ""pp1"", ""protein phosphatase 1"", ""modifier genes"", ""nuclear envelope""]"
